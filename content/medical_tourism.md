IMAGE OF MRI

That's my spine, and if you know what to look for you can see that the intervertebral disk is bulging and pressing on my spinal column. At the time this photo was taken I was unable to sit through lunch. I needed help, and in this article I'll describe my experience with medical tourism in India.

About me: I'm not Indian, I speak little Marathi beyond "pani" and "buzz", and in general I stick out like a very tall fair and lovely advertisement over here. My girlfriend is an African woman about 3-5" taller than the average man, and with a hairstyle that is rather uncommon over here. If we visit a restaurant twice, we are immediately recognized the second time around - suffice it to say that we have no chance of passing for locals. Nevertheless, I'm familiar with the country - I know when an auto driver is ripping me off and I negotiate better than many Indians. So in short, I have a mild advantage for medical tourism over the average westerner, but not a huge one.

Currency and numbers: At the time I'm writing this, and the time of my surgery, 1 USD = 60 INR. India has an interesting number system - 1 lakh = 1,00,000 (one hundred thousand), and 1 crore = 1,00,00,000 = 100 lakh. So 1 lakh rupees = $1600, and 1 crore rupees = $160,000.

This post is written mainly from an American perspective. When I was in the US recently, an [article about spine surgery](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/drive-by-doctoring-surprise-medical-bills.html) was floating around. The punch line? In the US, it's difficult to get a doctor to give you a cost estimate *before* you undergo surgery. In the particular case discussed by this article, which is apparently not particularly uncommon, there was $117,000 *discrepancy* between the estimated and final bill.

I'm going to discuss an experience I had with a similar surgery over here.

# How it all started

While I was in the UK at the beginning of the year, I started feeling a slight twinge of pain in my back. Mostly I'd feel it when I woke up. I paid attention and cut back on certain activites (read: weighted squats), but mostly lived my life like normal. Issues like this sometimes arise for me - I've known for a while that I had disk herniations in my lower back. It's a peril of being tall.

Over time, after I came to India, things started becoming progressively worse. I started feeling the pain in my leg during a number of unilateral exercises - one leg squats, one hand pushups. I slowed down, ran less, and overall my quality of life took a dip.

Things became noticeably bad when everyday non-exercise activites started to cause pain. Things started getting worse in July - at some point that month I went on a date and I had to stand up twice during dinner to make the pain go away. The situation got progressively worse until eventually I was more or less unable to sit at all. Standing up or lying down was fine - sitting was the only issue.

In picture form, this was my problem:

![herniation diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/Lumbar_Disc_Lesions%2C_Classification_by_Harry_Gouvas.jpg)

I visited Rajesh Parasnis at [Oyster and Pearl Clinic](http://www.onphospital.com/) (you can interpret the link and namedrop as an endorsement), and we went through all the basics; physical therapy, rest, anti-inflammatories, nothing worked. Eventually we tried a [Selective Nerve Root Block](http://www.spinesurgery.com/pain-management/selective-nerve-root-block) which is an injection of cortisone into the disk and nerve area. The goal is to reduce the swelling of the disk and lower the pressure.

The injection cost about 10,000rs or $160. The procedure was about 30 minutes, followed by a bit more time waiting to recover and let the medication kick in. The hospital in which it was done was extremely clean and modern. The only observable difference between Oyster&Pearl and a US hospital is that at a US hospital, only the doctors will be Indian.

I didn't feel great after the injection, but the pain substantially decreased the next day. Overall, things were looking good. I felt no pain, I resumed exercise, and sucessfully flew to the US to attend my sister's wedding. Unfortunately, while I was in the US, the problem came back. It was worse than before.

I investigated getting medical treatment in the US, but that was difficult. Most doctors refused to even give me an appointment; I overheard one talking with the receptionist, and he told her I was probably seeking drugs. Yep, recreational SNRB injections, that's a plausible idea. A couple of receptionists said the doctor might do it, but they were unable to tell me the price. A doctor visit to determine whether the injection is appropriate would cost $200, however. I attempted unsuccessfully to sign up for Obamacare. Had I been successful the price would have been about $350/month. Eventually I found a doctor in distant Brooklyn who would do the cortizone injection; after peeing in a cup and answering a questionaire about whether I've ever sold prescription medication she consented to give me another SNRB.

After a partial recovery I flew back to India with the expectation that surgery was in my future. In case anyone is wondering, I did stand up for the duration of the 14 hour flight. I survived takeoff and landing via illegally obtained Xanax.

# The surgery

Compared to the US, the medical experience in India is quite smooth. The doctor said I needed surgery. I asked the price and I was told it would be 1.4 lakh for the surgery, plus another few thousand for incidental expenses. I agreed to the price and was admitted to the hospital the next day. The consultation with the doctor before hand cost me 400rs only (maybe $6-7), and even without seeing the doctor the receptionist was able to give me a price quote for the surgery.

They've got me on a lot of drugs in that picture - I'd look a lot less happy otherwise. The unkempt appearance is because at this point it had been about 2 months since I was able to sit down long enough for a haircut.

After I got out of surgery I wasn't nearly so happy. There were no painkillers, I was desperately thirsty, and also forbidden from drinking anything for several hours. But the pain in my back was gone.

Unlike a US hospital (or so I'm told), they were in no rush to get me out the door. This is in spite of the fact that I paid a flat fee for the surgery plus the hospital visit - i.e., they were not making any money by keeping me in there an extra day. I stayed in for 4 days afterwards - even (very bad) food was included in the price. I probably would have stayed a 5'th day if I didn't insist that they let me leave.

I had to pay my bill on the way out. Before I do the big reveal and say how much I actually paid, go take a quick skim of [this NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/drive-by-doctoring-surprise-medical-bills.html). The summary of the article; in the US, the hospital will only give you a rough guesstimate of the price before you go under the knife. Sometimes patients get big surprises, like a $117,000 bill from an *out of network* surgeon they've never heard of.

Here's the final bill.

I didn't take a great picture. But the total cost of the surgery was 1.4 lakh only. That's right - there were **no billing errors**.

In addition, I paid maybe 2000rs for medication afterwards and 500rs for a back brace. This was no surprise - the lady who gave me the price quote told me to expect to spend 2000-4000 on medications and such.  So the total cost was within 2% of the exact quote.

# The aftermath

The surgery is over, and the recovery has been pretty straightforward. The doctors told me that as of 2015 I can resume normal levels of exercise.

Apart from exercise, I've already resumed normal activities. The original problem manifested as an inability to sit down. This is me a week after I was discharged from the hospital, enjoying brunch in a comfortable sitting position.

# Eyeball repairs - my first medical tourism experience

My first official bit of medical tourism was several months back. My problem: I was born with a congenital defect that blurs my vision. I worked around this defect for a long time by putting corrective lenses in front of my eyeballs, but that became extremely inconvenient. During exercise the corrective lenses would fall off if I did burpees or pushups. When it rained they would get wet and difficult to see through. Since getting rid of them I've also observed people to find me more sexually attractive and less intelligent.

Through the magic of lasers, this problem is permanently fixable. I did some research and knew the procedure I wanted - [wavefront guided femtolasik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntraLASIK). I started looking up prices, and a typical price in the US was $2000 or 1.2 lakh rupees **per eye**. Most of the better places will cost considerably more. I started googling for prices in India but that was rather more difficult - the general price range I got was anywhere from 15-40k rupees per eye. Quite a price difference. So I asked around and got a recommendation - Aditya Kelkar at the [National Institute of Opthamology](http://www.nioeyes.com/), supposedly one of the best places in India.

It was a little difficult to find the place, but when I got there the facility was clean and modern - more or less what you'd expect in the US, apart from minor differences like the lack of paper cups for the water cooler. (The custom here is a shared metal cup which you don't put your lips on.)

Once I got there, they were a little surprised to see a foreigner walking in and asking for service, but very professional. On the day I walked in I was given an examination to determine if LASIK was a reasonable procedure for me - I forget the exact price, but I believe it was was approximately 3000INR ~= $50. After this exam revealed LASIK was appropriate, I had a consultation with the doctor. He explained the procedure and the risks in a very low pressure environment. One thing I liked a lot about him was that he steered me away from a different form of LASIK which sounds less scary (it does not require the creation of a flap in the eye), but which is less effective.

After a few days of thought I decided to go ahead with the surgery. We did one eye only at first since I wanted to make sure that if something bad happened (there is a small risk of infection) or if the results did not give me vision as good as I had with glasses, I could skip the second eye. This was not the standard procedure, but Kelkar was happy to let me roll with it. The first eye took several weeks to recover, but eventually I was completely satisfied with my vision. During the recovery I was able to function normally, travel to [Jaipur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur) and [Mumbai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai) and generally enjoy myself. When I returned to Pune I had the right eye done - recovery in that eye was only a few days.

![medical tourism](|filename|/blog_media/2014/medical_tourism/eyeball_surgery.jpg)

Overall, I had a great experience. The total cost was 34.5k rupees = $550/eye, plus another 1,000 or so rupees on medication (eye drops, painkillers).
