[String Interning done Right](https://getkerf.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/string-interning-done-right/) - from Scott Locklin. From what I can tell, it's a bit specific to column oriented databases where the main string field contain highly repeated small values like "SPY" or "ARCA", but it's still a great read.

A ["tech bro"](https://justink.svbtle.com/open-letter-to-mayor-ed-lee-and-greg-suhr-police-chief) wrote a letter to the Mayor of SF complaining about the homeless. He was widely criticized for it, but the actual letter is worth reading. *"A distraught, and high person was right in front of the restaurant, yelling, screaming, yelling about cocaine, and even, attempted to pull his pants down and show his genitals."* Apparently the "tech bro" believes that a legitimate function of government is preventing such things.

[Uber for Welfare](http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/1/uber-welfare-sharing-gig-economy-000031#ixzz3yfWmNK9i). A nice article discussing how Welfare to Work can be improved by integrating with the gig economy.

[Why India Needs it's Quack Doctors](https://www.good.is/articles/why-india-needs-its-quack-doctors).
