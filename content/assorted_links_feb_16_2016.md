[NEJM suggests it's rude to use an author's own data to prove them wrong](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1516564). Um, that's not how science works.

[The Real Tragedy in Flint](http://gregbranchwords.com/2016/01/17/the-real-tragedy-in-flint/).

[An anonymous response to dangerous FOSS Codes of Conduct](https://4fa6134ddde55ae0092b69e1eb287d2840301d0a.googledrive.com/host/0B6kjFNJtv3yzUjY4M21QenJzdGc/)

[A quantitative analysis of free speech](http://anonymousmugwump.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/the-empirics-of-free-speech-and_29.html?m=1).

[An unconditional increase in teacher salary has no beneficial effect](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~kamurali/papers/Working%20Papers/Double%20for%20Nothing%20%28Current%20WP%29.pdf).

[Fools Gold: An Illustrated Critique of Differential Privacy](http://www.jetlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bambauer_Final.pdf) and [On Syntactic Anonymity and Differential Privacy](http://www.openu.ac.il/personal_sites/tamirtassa/download/journals/anonymity_dp.pdf) are both good critiques of the practical usefulness of differential privacy.

[Class Systems in America](http://siderea.livejournal.com/1260265.html?format=light), and relatedly [Castes of the United States](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/05/castes-of-united-states.html) and [The 3-Ladder System of Social Class in the US](https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/the-3-ladder-system-of-social-class-in-the-u-s/). Michael O. Church and Mencius Moldbug are mostly agreeing on something.

Sometime back Paul Graham wrote about [a way to detect bias](http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html), namely by measuring the relative ability of people who are *selected*. I.e., if women are discriminated against, they should outperform men. I did a little more [math on that topic](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2015/paul_grahams_bias_test.html). Now Jonathan Adler is using this idea to [investigate whether conservative law professors are discriminated against](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/01/revisiting-whether-conservative-and-libertarian-law-professors-are-more-productive-than-their-peers/). Apparently conservative law professors are significantly more productive than their liberal counterparts, suggesting that there may be possible discrimination.

[Systems, not Sith: How Inter-service Rivalries Doomed the Galactic Empire](https://www.overthinkingit.com/2012/09/17/star-wars-empire-inter-service-rivalries/?page=all)

[Hedonic Adjustments over long periods of time](http://ashokarao.com/2016/02/02/hedonic-adjustments-over-long-periods-of-time/). This article argues a point I've long held, that inflation is non-transitive. I.e., the rate of inflation from 1970->2016 is not equal to inflation 1970->1990 + 1990->2016. The reason for this is ultimately changes in the basket of goods - changing the basket of goods gets you a very good inflation rate in any given year, but a completely nonsensical one over time.

[Nice introductory article on covariance/contravariance](http://typelevel.org/blog/2016/02/04/variance-and-functors.html).

[Why Costs Matter](https://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2016/01/31/why-costs-matter/) - an article explaining why transit activists need to focus on out of control construction costs. My favorite point of comparison is that the NYC 7-line extension (1 mile of subway, 1 station) cost $2.4 billion, while the Delhi metro (132 miles of track, 160 stations) cost $5 billion.

[Silicon Valley Has an Asian-people Problem](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/silicon-valley-has-an-asian-people-problem/) - the first news report on ethnic diversity in the tech industry which accurately describes the numbers.

[Github: The Quiet Death of One Man's Dream](http://danieltenner.com/2016/02/06/github-the-quiet-death-of-one-mans-dream/).

[Interview with a Quant, Pt 1](https://www.quandl.com/blog/interview-with-a-quant-part-one). Discussion of how to find/test trading strategies. Looking forward to part 2.

[How to become a Bayesian in 8 easy steps](http://alexanderetz.com/2016/02/07/understanding-bayes-how-to-become-a-bayesian-in-eight-easy-steps/). Good listing of papers to read.

Apparently the SAT, including SAT math, will become [more reading heavy](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/us/sat-test-changes.html). It's supposed to be harder for people who are good at math but might not speak English at home. I wonder what [group of people](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/09/03/sat-scores-drop-and-racial-gaps-remain-large) that is?

Scott Alexander [takes down the github male/female pull request article](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/12/before-you-get-too-excited-about-that-github-study/). He also has a [great comment](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/12/before-you-get-too-excited-about-that-github-study/#comment-325869).
