[What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell 2.0](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#cabal), by Stephen Diel.

Zachary David has a nice [series](http://zacharydavid.com/2014/03/on-hft-assumptions-agent-based-modeling-and-a-philosophy-of-error/) of [posts](http://zacharydavid.com/2014/04/on-hft-part-ii-bugs-features-and-aggressive-incompetence/) on [HFT](http://zacharydavid.com/2014/04/on-hft-part-iii-still-confused-about-high-frequency-trading-yes/). Yes, I'm getting sick of the topic too.

Win-vector has some nice [thoughts on a/b testing and bandit algorithms](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/04/bandit-formulations-for-ab-tests-some-intuition/). Worth a read.

Apparently Thomas Piketty acknowledges that volatility for capital is about [5-10x as volatile as wages](http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/376345/thomas-piketty-made-case-privatizing-social-security-arpit-gupta). See my related post about [volatility drag](http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2014/piketty_inequality_and_volatility.html). As a result, Piketty believes it would be harmful to turn wage earners into capital holders.
