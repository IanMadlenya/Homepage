[What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell 2.0](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#cabal), by Stephen Diel.

[The Control Group is Out Of Control](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/)

Zachary David has a nice [series](http://zacharydavid.com/2014/03/on-hft-assumptions-agent-based-modeling-and-a-philosophy-of-error/) of [posts](http://zacharydavid.com/2014/04/on-hft-part-ii-bugs-features-and-aggressive-incompetence/) on [HFT](http://zacharydavid.com/2014/04/on-hft-part-iii-still-confused-about-high-frequency-trading-yes/). Yes, I'm getting sick of the topic too.

Win-vector has some nice [thoughts on a/b testing and bandit algorithms](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/04/bandit-formulations-for-ab-tests-some-intuition/). Worth a read.

[Building a Better Action Hero](http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/print-view/building-a-bigger-action-hero-20140418). Although the article is about hollywood, all of us should take it as a wake up call.

[Scott Sumner on capital and other income](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=26636), and on [measuring economic inequality](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/04/theres_only_one.html).

My [post on HFT](/blog/2014/quote_stuffing_is_a_software_bug.html) has gotten Nanex a little [butthurt](https://twitter.com/nanexllc/status/459132238412914688).

A [harsh review of Piketty](http://updatedpriors.blogspot.in/2014/03/capital-in-partial-equilibrium.html) over on [Updated Priors](http://updatedpriors.blogspot.in/). I'm only about 1/2 of the way through the book, but I agree completely - Piketty should write down an unambiguous math model. But I suspect that if he did that, his thesis would be far more vulnerable to informed criticism. See also [A comment about math and economics](http://updatedpriors.blogspot.in/2013/08/a-comment-on-math-and-economics.html).

11 years ago, the economics profession also worked out a [standard model](http://www.econ.umn.edu/~vr0j/papers/maxrefin.pdf) of inequality. The conclusions are far more moderate than Piketty's claims, and the math seems reasonably solid. Wish Piketty was as clear as these guys.

Apparently Thomas Piketty acknowledges that volatility for capital is about [5-10x as volatile as wages](http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/376345/thomas-piketty-made-case-privatizing-social-security-arpit-gupta). See my related post about [volatility drag](http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2014/piketty_inequality_and_volatility.html). As a result, Piketty believes it would be harmful to turn wage earners into capital holders.

Eliezer Yudkowsky on [Marketing](http://lesswrong.com/lw/vv/logical_or_connectionist_ai/): "...the real cleverness is in how neural networks were marketed. They left out the math." Applies also to Piketty.
