{% mark excerpt %}

Given the commodification and decline of high frequency trading, I was a bit surprised to see that Michael Lewis [wrote a book](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/31/us-markets-hft-flashboys-idUSBREA2U03D20140331) on the topic. Not only that, but based on the reviews (I haven't read the actual book), it sounds like a scary "tell-all" book revealing how HFT rips off "the little guy". At least, it rips off the little guy when the "little guy" wants to move millions of shares in a single day.

After all, doesn't every retail trader and other "little guy" occasionally attempt to dump $60M worth of GOOG in a single day? That's what you do when cashing out of your Roth IRA, right?

So I'm a former high frequency trader. I've even written a popular [tutorial](/blog/2012/hft_apology.html) on the subject. So today I'm going to give all my readers a secret trick they can use to avoid getting ripped off from HFT's.

# How an HFT makes his money

As I explain in the aforementioned [tutorial](/blog/2012/hft_apology.html), HFT's sell liquidity. This means that at any given time, HFT's will have open orders on the matching engine to buy and/or sell a stock:

    SELL(100 shares @ $50.90)
    -------------------------
    BUY(100 shares @ $50.80)

The market maker (High Frequency Trader or HFT) makes money off the spread - when you want to buy immediately, you *take liquidity*. This means you buy shares from him at $50.90. Then when you want to unload the stock, you sell shares to him at $50.80.

He makes $0.10 off the trade, at least in aggregate.

# How to avoid paying the HFT

It's very simple: the HFT is selling liquidity - don't buy it.

This can be accomplished in a number of ways. The simplest is merely not crossing the spread. If the Bid/Ask spreadis $50.80/50.90, you can simply refuse to pay $50.90 for shares. You place a *limit order* for 100 shares @ $50.80 - then whenever someone comes along and is willing to sell for $50.80, they will first sell to the HFT (who's order is already out there) and then sell to you.

Alternately, if you want to be the first to trade, you can place an order to buy 100 shares @ $50.81.

## But what if the market moves?

That's a problem. It might happen that you place an order to buy @ $50.80, but in the time it takes you to place your order, the market could move. The evil HFT might rapidly change the bid/ask spread before you reach the market to:

    SELL(100 shares @ $50.80)
    -------------------------
    BUY(100 shares @ $50.70)

At this point, although you didn't intend to pay for liquidity, you wind up doing it anyway.

Enter ALO orders.
