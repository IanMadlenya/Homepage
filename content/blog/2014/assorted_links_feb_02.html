[11 A/B Split Testing Mistakes I See Businesses Make All The Time](http://conversionxl.com/12-ab-split-testing-mistakes-i-see-businesses-make-all-the-time)

Interesting, and unpleasant: [Narratives of Racism in Delhi University](http://nsi-delhi.blogspot.in/2011/01/skin-deep-narratives-of-racism-in-delhi.html?m=1). I've never been to Delhi, but I got the impression that Pune is not so bad. There certainly is some racism, but from what I saw the shared comraderie of computer geeks seemed to outweigh it. Maybe I'll visit Delhi and find out if it's as awful as everyone says.
