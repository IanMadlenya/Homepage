[A Fervent defense of Frequentist Statistics](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jne/a_fervent_defense_of_frequentist_statistics/). Eliezer Yudkowsky's comments are also well worth reading. Most notably:

> Who are these mysterious straw Bayesians who refuse to use algorithms that work well and could easily turn out to have a good explanation later? Bayes is epistemological background not a toolbox of algorithms.

After thinking about the online learning example discussed in the above post, I came to the realization that [Eliezer Yudkowsky came to a long time back](http://lesswrong.com/lw/vq/the_weighted_majority_algorithm/). Randomization (aka "non-bayesian") algorithms are effective in adversarial problems not because Bayesian reasonining fails, but because randomization reduces the advantage that your adversaries intelligence provides. The adversarial bandit is fundamentally not a statistics problem at all.
