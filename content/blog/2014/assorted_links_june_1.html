The [Equal Weights Theorem](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~hwainer/Readings/Wainer_Estimating%20Coefficients%20in%20Linear%20Models.pdf) proves that provided you know the direction of causality, assigning *equal weights* to each predictor variable is almost as good as linear regression. I suspect this is strongly related to the success of the [top 10](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/01/04/repost-prediction-the-lasso-vs-just-using-the-top-10-predictors/) predictor.

The Fed's new risk retention rules require lenders to [take less risk than they did before the crisis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz9vO1qp2OywejlRUDNWUmExZW95WFpFczBnNlh0WW44Q0hz/edit). It's a very interesting read that gets into details and busts a few myths.

Interesting critique of Piketty's [empirics](http://www.cato.org/blog/piketty-problems-top-1-shares-income-wealth-are-nothing-1917-28) rather than his theory. Very useful read.
