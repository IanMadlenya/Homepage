The [Equal Weights Theorem](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~hwainer/Readings/Wainer_Estimating%20Coefficients%20in%20Linear%20Models.pdf) proves that provided you know the direction of causality, assigning *equal weights* to each predictor variable is almost as good as linear regression. I suspect this is strongly related to the success of the [top 10](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/01/04/repost-prediction-the-lasso-vs-just-using-the-top-10-predictors/) predictor.

[How to get Dreadful SQL performance](http://www.roughsea.com/vids/SQL_Best_Practices.html)

[10 things statistics taught us about big data](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/05/22/10-things-statistics-taught-us-about-big-data-analysis/)

The Fed's new risk retention rules require lenders to [take less risk than they did before the crisis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz9vO1qp2OywejlRUDNWUmExZW95WFpFczBnNlh0WW44Q0hz/edit). It's a very interesting read that gets into details and busts a few myths.

[Bayesian Bodybuilding?](http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/)

[Alternatives to GADTs in Scala](http://pchiusano.github.io/2014-05-20/scala-gadts.html)

Interesting critique of Piketty's [empirics](http://www.cato.org/blog/piketty-problems-top-1-shares-income-wealth-are-nothing-1917-28) rather than his theory. Very useful read. And [Debraj Ray on Piketty's Theory](http://debrajray.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/nit-piketty.html).

After discovering Debraj Ray, I also noticed her article [encouraging cricketers and movie stars to explicitly denounce rapists](http://debrajray.blogspot.in/2013/08/role-models-and-sexual-violence.html). (This is probably less interesting to my non-Indian readers.) Her blog is hit or miss (lots of boring personal stuff), but her hits are interesting. Definitely worth checking out.

Scott Alexander asks [naughty questions](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/26/compound-interest-is-the-least-powerful-force-in-the-universe/) about Ta-Nehisi Coates' [The Case for Reparations](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/). I'd also ask another naughty question. Let us take as a given that Person A did bad things to Person B. What moral axioms and reasoning lead to the conclusion that Person C owes reparations to Person D? Sadly, Coates basically ignores this question.
