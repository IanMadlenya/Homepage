A [lot](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jessecolombo/2013/12/19/bitcoin-may-be-following-this-classic-bubble-stages-chart/) [of](http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/blog/2013/12/12/these-three-graphs-prove-that-bitcoin-is-a-speculative-bubble) [people](http://kottke.org/13/12/is-bitcoin-a-speculative-bubble) believe that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a speculative bubble. Scott Sumner is a notable person who [disagrees](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=25011), and believes that Bitcoin may be rationally priced based on the low probability of high expected rewards.

Most of the arguments claiming BTC is a bubble are nonsensical. They tend to fall into two categories: "OMFG prices went sky high, must be a bubble", and "BTC, like the USD, has nothing backing it, therefore it must be a bubble" (some of the latter critics recognize that USD has the same problem, others do cognitive dissonance). I'm not going to address the question of whether BTC is a bubble, because I don't actually understand things well enough to give an answer.

Instead, I'm going to describe how to use mainstream textbook macroeconomic theory to determine the "true price" of BTC. So you can think of it as a tutorial for speculating on Bitcoin - assuming you can predict the future, I'll give you a set of formulas you can plug your predictions into. Then you can use the formulas to determine the "true price" of BTC and speculate on that basis - if the "true price" is higher than the current price, you should buy, otherwise sell (or short).

**Important note:** I'm not going to provide any *trading strategies* in this post. If I had a trading strategy that I believed in, I'd put my money where my mouth is (anyone who refuses to do the same is full of crap). I'm merely explaining how to turn *predictions* like "bitcoin transaction costs will go down" or "bitcoin transactions will drastically increase" into a trading strategy.

# Why do people want money?

Fundamentally, this is the important question to answer. Let's think about all the unpleasant properties of money. It tends to bear a negative interest rate, or at best (in the case of BTC) has a long term interest rate of zero. In the case of physical money it's a pain to carry around and it can be damaged. In the case of cryptocurrencies you need to maintain a wallet and protect yourself from hackers. As far as preserving the value of my wealth, there are far better options - SPY, for example.

In theory, I should have no reason to hold Dollars, Pounds, Rupees or Bitcoins.

So lets put this theory to the test. What's in my wallet?

I guess that theory is now debunked. So why am I carrying all this paper? One very simple reason.

**Auto drivers don't accept credit cards.**

I need to carry currency to perform my everyday transactions - getting laundry done, taking an auto, buying a dosa, etc. For this very important reason, I'm willing to store some of my wealth in the form of flimsy little pieces of paper which will earn me a rate of return of approximately -10%.

So we arrive at the first fundamental principle of currencies. If people need to perform transactions with a currency then that currency will have a positive value.

# Applying Supply and Demand

As economically-minded folks, we'll be using Supply&Demand to figure out the price of money.

## Demand

Now that we've established that people want to hold a currency, the important question to answer is "how much?" I have a few thousand Rupees in my pocket, but that's far less than my life savings. I have a lot more wealth invested in SPY, USD, and various interest-bearing USD-denominated securities. So how can we determine how much money I put into Rupees?

The [Baumol-Tobin model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol-Tobin_model) provides a good way to think about things. It's not a perfect model, as I'll explain below - it misses some important facts. But it provides a useful way to think about things.

The first important fact to consider is transaction costs. If I want to convert from USD to INR, I need to take an auto to an ATM and then pay my bank a foreign transaction fee. Even if I were in the US, there would still be labor involved in holding enough cash.

The other cost in carrying cash is opportunity cost - cash in my pocket is not earning interest.

If you work out the details from this model and do the math, you discover the following equation for monetary demand:

    M(P) = P sqrt(C Y / 2 R)

In this equation, `P` is the price level, `C` is the transaction costs, `Y` is real consumption, and `R` is interest rates.

Another common model comes from the [quantity theory of money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_Theory_of_Money), and this treats monetary demand as:

    M(P) = P Y / V

where `V` is the [velocity of money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money).

## Supply

For BTC, the supply (in the long run) is pretty easy to figure out - 21 million. There is of course a small probability that the Bitcoin system will collectively agree to allow inflation or a different number, but I'll ignore this for the moment.

For USD, it's much more difficult. To figure out money supply, you need to guess the actions of the Federal Reserve over the long term. Since this post is about speculating on BTC, I won't bother to get into thta.

## Computing a price level

Now that we know the money supply, to find the price we simply need to figure out where supply meets demand. For the Baumol-Tobin model, we have:

    21e6 = P sqrt(C Y / 2 R)

Or:

    P = 21e6 sqrt(2R/CY)

If you use the Quantity Theory of Money, you come up with:

    P = 21e6 V / Y

There is a significant difference between these two equations, so it's important to figure out what theory of monetary demand you find most plausible.

It's important to note that all the quantities I'm listing here apply *to the bitcoin economy only*. The dollar economy is relevant only insofar as

# Price level vs Exchange Rate

At this point I want to emphasize that the *price level* is not the same thing as the *exchange rate*. The [price level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_level) of a currency is a (mostly hypothetical) measure of the overall prices of goods and services in an economy.

To compute an *exchange rate*, we need to go a bit further. Remember that `P y` has units of *nominal consumption* for a fixed quantity of real consumption `y`. Note that I'm using a lowercase `y` to distinguish between *aggregate consumption* (used in the previous section, called `Y`) and consumption of a fixed basket of goods (called `y`).

In the absence of arbitrage opportunities (efficient markets), `BTC price = P y = Dollar price = P_dollar y`. This implies that `BTC price / Dollar price = P y / P_dollar y = P/P_dollar`. So computing exchange rates is merely a matter of computing the ratios of price levels between BTC and dollars.

# It's difficult to make predictions, especially about the future

To engage in financial speculation, you need to be able to predict the future. To determine the price level of BTC, we ultimately need to predict interest rates, transaction costs and real BTC-denominated consumption. (I'm implicitly sticking to the Baumol-Tobin model - use another if you like.)

## Interest rates

This is the least important quantity to measure, at least if you trading dollars vs bitcoins. The reason is that interest rates affect price levels for both dollars and bitcoins identically - they both have a `sqrt(R)` at the bottom.

    exchange rate = P / P_dollar
                  = 21e6 sqrt(2R/CY) / (# of dollars)sqrt(2R/C_dollar Y_dollar)
                  = (21e6 / (# of dollars)) sqrt(C_dollar Y_dollar / C Y)

So if you take the USD as a benchmark rate, and trade BTC against it, then you don't care about interest rates at all.

## Real Consumption

This is an important quantity, and will differ drastically from the dollar economy. The reason for this is that Bitcoins and other currencies are not close substitutes for one another. Most auto drivers will not accept BTC, and most drug dealers on Silk Road will not accept USD or INR.

Another big use I expect to see in the future is cross-border transactions - paying one's web designer or other outsourced human in BTC rather than USD (which is then converted by some third party into Baht or Rupees or whatever). The cross-border trade segment of the economy will not necessarily move the same way as the rest of the economy. This is particularly true for nations with capital controls.

If you want to predict real consumption, you need to somehow figure out which transactions will be done with BTC and how large these transactions will be.

## Transaction Costs

This is another biggie. The lower the transaction costs of BTC are, the fewer BTC I need to hold. I can just convert USD or INR to BTC immediately whenever I need to, which means that the inventory I need is lower.

On the other hand, one of the promises of BTC is lower transaction costs than other money transfer mechanisms. The lower the transaction costs are, the more likely I am to actually use BTC. So a lowering of transaction costs here will not necessarily result in a commensurate decrease in the price level of BTC - lower transaction costs might result in higher real consumption. I.e., while `C` might go down, `CY` might go up (or remain flat).

## Putting it all together

Once you have a predictive model of `C`, `Y` and `R`, you run it and plug the result into the formula `P = 21e6 sqrt(2R/CY)`. This will tell you the bitcoin price level. You can then compute an exchange rate between BTC and Dollars/Rupees/etc, compare market prices to your own speculative price, and trade appropriately.

# Example

For this example, I'll make the following assumptions.

**First**, international trade is modelled as being proportional to (say 5%) of the dollar economy.

**Second**, the size of the BTC economy is modelled as being proportional to some fraction of international trade - illegal uses become negligible, and for domestic uses, dollars are preferable.

**Third**, the constant of proportionality is inversely proportional to transaction costs. I.e., higher transaction costs mean fewer transactions use BTC.

As an equation, this means that:

    Y = Y_dollar (A / C)

where `A` is the product of the constant of proportionalities from the first two equations. Roughly speaking, bigger `A` means more international trade and more

If we plug this into the equation for the exchange rate, we get:

    exchange rate = (21e6 / (# of dollars)) sqrt(C_dollar Y_dollar / [C Y_dollar (A / C)])
                  = (21e6 / (# of dollars)) sqrt(C_dollar / A )

So now we come to a very simple model. More dollars in circulation reduces this exchange rate, which is exactly what we expect. Higher transaction costs with dollars increase it - this is also expected, since higher transaction costs increase the demand for dollars. And it is inversely proportional to the square root of the size of the bitcoin economy. Of course, estimating `A` is a tricky question, but that's why speculators earn good money.
