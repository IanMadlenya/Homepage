[A Fervent defense of Frequentist Statistics](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jne/a_fervent_defense_of_frequentist_statistics/). Eliezer Yudkowsky's comments are also well worth reading. Most notably:

> Who are these mysterious straw Bayesians who refuse to use algorithms that work well and could easily turn out to have a good explanation later? Bayes is epistemological background not a toolbox of algorithms.

After thinking about the online learning example discussed in the above post, I came to the realization that [Eliezer Yudkowsky came to a long time back](http://lesswrong.com/lw/vq/the_weighted_majority_algorithm/). Randomization (aka "non-bayesian") algorithms are effective in adversarial problems not because Bayesian reasonining fails, but because randomization reduces the advantage that your adversaries intelligence provides. The adversarial bandit is fundamentally [not a statistics problem](/blog/2014/adversarial_bandit_is_not_statistics_problem.html) at all.

[Scala's Types of Types](http://ktoso.github.io/scala-types-of-types/). Great article explaining Scala's type system.

[Peter Thiel is wrong about the minimum wage](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/02/the_minimum_wag_3.html?utm_source=chris_stucchio). This example just goes to show why a concrete model is so important - Peter Thiel is a very smart guy, yet his verbal reasoning is easily debunked by a very simple graph.

[Female Risk Aversion](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/02/24/charts-of-the-day-female-risk-aversion-edition/)

[Hip Gadgets For The Developing World Won't Solve Global Poverty](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3026537/hip-gadgets-arent-going-to-solve-global-poverty-stop-making-them). See also [this article](http://stayingfortea.org/2012/06/23/deflating-the-soccket-ball/?relatedposts_exclude=714).

[Republicans understand evolution better than democrats](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/25/most-democrats-dont-know-it-takes-a-year-for-the-earth-to-go-around-the-sun/). They don't *agree* with it, but they understand it. Republicans are also more likely to know that the Earth revolves around the Sun once every year. Stereotype busted, I guess.

[Duality and Coclustering](http://shapeofdata.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/duality-and-coclustering/)

DO NOT USE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. See the paper [Robust Misinterpretation of Confidence Intervals](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/inpress/HoekstraEtAlPBR.pdf). They are a *useless* tool for communicating with non-statisticians - anyone without a PhD will interpret your confidence interval as a credible interval. I've all observed this in practice, but it's good to have stats to back it up.
