[Actors are overly nondeterministic](http://pchiusano.blogspot.in/2013/09/actors-are-overly-nondeterminstic.html). Argues also that futures have the same property - somewhat of a counterpoint to a [post of mine](http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/actors_vs_futures.html) on the same topic. Overall an excellent article, and it makes me want to take a much closer look at [scalaz-stream](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-stream). The author has [two](http://pchiusano.blogspot.in/2010/01/actors-are-not-good-concurrency-model.html) [other](http://pchiusano.blogspot.in/2010/03/follow-up-to-actors-are-not-good.html) posts on the topic from a while back.

[Total security in a PostgreSQL database](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-postgresecurity/). You can get a lot of mileage out of simply creating three roles - readonly, readwrite and DDL. But you can definitely do more.

[Freakonomics: Women are paid less because they dislike competition](http://freakonomics.com/2013/10/18/a-unifying-theory-of-why-women-earn-less/)

[Naive Bayes classifier in Scalding](https://github.com/alaiacano/scalding-nb). If you are stuck dealing with Hadoop and nonsense like [this](http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/gc_overhead_limit.html), it seems pretty useful. The example used in the docs is the [Iris](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) data set - [Don't use Hadoop](http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html) for a data set with 150 points.

[We're not even trying](http://scattered-thoughts.net/blog/2014/01/27/were-not-even-trying/). Did you ever think of automating your `print` debugging?

[Random Inequalities](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/26/random-inequalities-i/), [part ii](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/26/random-inequalities-ii-analytical-results/) and [part iii](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/07/26/random-inequalities-iii-numerical-results/).
