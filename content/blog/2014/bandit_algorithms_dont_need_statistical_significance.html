My cofounder wrote an interesting [blog post](http://www.bayesianwitch.com/blog/2014/bandit_algorithms_statistically_insignificant.html) about the unimportance of statistical significance when running bandit algorithms.

Here is something really cool: suppose you have a page which will receive only 3 pageviews ever. You can still increase your conversion rate with a custom Bayesian bandit algorithm. The example is a bit contrived, but the math behind it is pretty interesting.
