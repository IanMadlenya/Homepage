Everything you think you know about test prep [is wrong](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/03/the-sat-test-prep-income-and-race.html). Specifically, test prep does almost nothing for test scores, there is little variation in test prep by income, and black people use it more than whites.

What do you do after a major policy change? [Alter your measurement technique](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/us/politics/census-survey-revisions-mask-health-law-effects.html) in order to make "before" and "after" results incomparable. By a strange coincidence, "we are expecting much lower [better] numbers" - policy wonks will of course recognize this is "just because of the questions and how they are asked", but somehow I doubt innumerate reporters and the general public will.

How [Biju Dominic](http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/9p2odmjfwsXQPVhnfEj39I/The-new-think-tank.html) reduced pedestrian deaths on Bombay railway tracks. Very interestingly, he didn't try to dissuade people from crossing - he just tried to make safe crossing easier.

On the topic of HFT (which I know I'm beating to death), [Felix Salmon reblogs Joe Stiglitz](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/04/15/the-problems-of-hft-joe-stiglitz-edition/), and the original [Joe Stiglitz](http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/news/conferences/14fmc/Stiglitz.pdf). Unlike Michael Lewis, this is a critique worth reading, even if I disagree with some of the underlying premises (part of Stiglitz critique of HFT is that markets are not valuable, therefore HFT improving markets is not).
