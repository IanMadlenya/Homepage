In 1971, much like today, there was a fair amount of debate over health insurance and it's effects on the population. Politicians and reporters made lots of claims about insurance - the lack of insurance kills people, insurance makes people healthier, that it's not cost effective, all the same sort of commentary we hear about the topic today. But in 1971, a very strange thing happened: science! A team of researchers at the RAND Corporation decided to run an [experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Health_Insurance_Experiment) to measure the effect of cost sharing on health and health care costs.

They set up a grand experiment in which they randomly allocated people to different health insurance plans. Between 1974 and 1982, 5809 people were randomly assigned to health insurance plans featuring 0%, 25%, 50% and 95% cost sharing, with a spending cap of $1000 ($4727.57 in 2013 dollars). The experiment gave us conclusive results - variation between the various health plans offered did not significantly affect health. However, cost sharing did reduce *spending* on health care by about 30%.

All in all, it was a perfect experiment and extremely practical science. In spite of the wonderful success of the RAND experiment, we've never deliberately tried to expand on it.

The closest we ever came in the field of health care was the [Oregon Medicaid Health Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Medicaid_health_experiment). Oregon wanted to expand Medicaid, but didn't have the money to expand it for everyone who wanted it. So they allowed previously uncovered people to sign up for Medicaid based on a lottery, and health care researchers took advantage of this for scientific purposes. Their results are also pretty solid, and rather unexpected.
