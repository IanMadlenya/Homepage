The [Equal Weights Theorem](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~hwainer/Readings/Wainer_Estimating%20Coefficients%20in%20Linear%20Models.pdf) proves that provided you know the direction of causality, assigning *equal weights* to each predictor variable is almost as good as linear regression. I suspect this is strongly related to the success of the [top 10](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/01/04/repost-prediction-the-lasso-vs-just-using-the-top-10-predictors/) predictor.

[How to get Dreadful SQL performance](http://www.roughsea.com/vids/SQL_Best_Practices.html)

[10 things statistics taught us about big data](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/05/22/10-things-statistics-taught-us-about-big-data-analysis/)

The Fed's new risk retention rules require lenders to [take less risk than they did before the crisis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz9vO1qp2OywejlRUDNWUmExZW95WFpFczBnNlh0WW44Q0hz/edit). It's a very interesting read that gets into details and busts a few myths.

[Bayesian Bodybuilding?](http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/)

[Alternatives to GADTs in Scala](http://pchiusano.github.io/2014-05-20/scala-gadts.html)

Interesting critique of Piketty's [empirics](http://www.cato.org/blog/piketty-problems-top-1-shares-income-wealth-are-nothing-1917-28) rather than his theory. Very useful read. And [Debraj Ray on Piketty's Theory](http://debrajray.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/nit-piketty.html). See also Tyler Cowen [comparing](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/06/piketty-v-solow.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+marginalrevolution%2Ffeed+%28Marginal+Revolution%29) Piketty's model to the standard Solow model. And [Arnold Kling reviews](http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2014/Klinglongitude.html) a book studying inequality with longitudinal data rather than cross sectional. Very different results. And of course Tino Sanandaji on the [wealth distribution in Sweden](http://super-economy.blogspot.in/2013/04/the-upper-class-and-wealth-inequality.html).

After discovering Debraj Ray, I also noticed her article [encouraging cricketers and movie stars to explicitly denounce rapists](http://debrajray.blogspot.in/2013/08/role-models-and-sexual-violence.html). (This is probably less interesting to my non-Indian readers.) Her blog is hit or miss (lots of boring personal stuff), but her hits are interesting. Definitely worth checking out.

Scott Alexander asks [naughty questions](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/26/compound-interest-is-the-least-powerful-force-in-the-universe/) about Ta-Nehisi Coates' [The Case for Reparations](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/). I'd also ask another naughty question. Let us take as a given that Person A did bad things to Person B. What moral axioms and reasoning lead to the conclusion that Person C owes reparations to Person D? Sadly, Coates basically ignores this question.

Just discovered [Colossal](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/), which is a wonderful art blog.

It's [surprisingly difficult](http://crookedtimber.org/2014/06/02/the-ethics-of-immigration-symposium-the-argument-from-democratic-principles/) to make a [moral argument](http://crookedtimber.org/2014/06/01/the-ethics-of-immigration-symposium-on-social-membership/) for open borders from a liberal perspective. Crooked Timber has quite a few posts on this topic, but nothing satisfying. In contrast, [Bryan Caplan's](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/02/open_borders_in.html) moral reasoning is quite simple and satisfying, but would of course lead to conclusions that Crooked Timber would find completely unacceptable.

Details on [normal approximations to other distributions](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/05/29/normal-approximation-details). Handy.

For all my non-American readers, here are [a couple](http://luminousalicorn.tumblr.com/post/54433820568/me-and-the-abstracted-persona-of-the-anti-ism-community) of [posts](http://luminousalicorn.tumblr.com/post/54496195336/tapaical-electric-boogalo) about bullying in the US.

[#yesallcats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23yesallcats&src=typd) because I can get myself out of a tree.
