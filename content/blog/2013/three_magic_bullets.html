I often hear it said that there are no magic bullets. I think this is bullshit. The reason people believe this is that when a magic bullet is discovered, you exploit the hell out of it. At this point, it ceases to be magic and just becomes the thing you do because it's obviously the right thing, and vastly better than all the alternatives. In my life I've encountered 3 magic bullets, and I want to give them the recognition they deserve.

In the beginning there was the filesystem. A heirarchical blob store - anything beyond that was entirely up to the programmer to handle. If the developer stores his data as binary structs,

## Hit the bag with your mouthguard in

The time had come. "Usted est√° listo para pelear", Hector (my coach) told me. ("You are ready to spar.") He told me to come next Saturday afternoon, and he'd bring someone matched to my weight and skill level. He told me to bring $100 or so, and he had buy new equipment: [headgear](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LPXKMK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004LPXKMK&linkCode=as2&tag=christuc-20), a [groin guard](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LQ3CKY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004LQ3CKY&linkCode=as2&tag=christuc-20) and a [mouthguard](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B55062/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001B55062&linkCode=as2&tag=christuc-20).

I stepped into the ring, simultaneously nervous and excited. When the bell rang I came out of my corner. I started throwing jabs, most of which landed on my opponents gloves. He started swinging and his jabs landed. The rest of the round consisted of me throwing a punch, getting hit in the face, and my coach yelling at me "keep your fucking hands up!" My diet for the following week consisted of curry, cottage cheese, and other foods requiring a minimum of chewing.

Hector kept me out of the ring for a few weeks and told me to focus on my defense. I barely threw any punches in practice, and mostly had the coaches hit me while I kept my hands up.

A few weeks later I was told I was ready to go again. This time my technique was better. I kept my hands up, kept my distance, and mostly didn't get hit. I threw some jabs, felt a few land, and successfully managed to avoid being a punching bag. I was also having a lot of difficulty going - by the time the bell rang, I was ready to puke. I rested for a minute and went in the second round. I barely got through half a round before I was completely gassed, barely throwing any punches, just working defense and waiting out the bell. Hector pulled me out after that, and I had no idea what happened.

I was very surprised by this - my cardio isn't bad. I regularly worked a lot harder than this in the gym without getting winded. The next day when I hit the gym I was given a tip. "Put your mouthguard in when you hit the bag." The bag doesn't hit me back, so it can't be to protect my teeth. But I did as I was told and wore my mouthguard whenever I did carido.

The next week I got in the ring and I was on fire. I could move, I could throw punches, and I lasted 4 rounds. It wasn't a lack of cardio which got my ass kicked the previous week - it was a bad breathing pattern. You breath differently with a mouthguard in than without. If you aren't used to it, you'll be unable to breath. Most gains are hard earned - you get stronger after thousands of burpees, pushups and pullups. But this was ridiculously easy - a week of practice breathing did more for me than months of cardio.
