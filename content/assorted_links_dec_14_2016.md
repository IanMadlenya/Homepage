## Math, Stats, Computer Science

[Problematic Presentation of Probabilities](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2016/11/problematic-presentation-of.html). About how difficult it is to explain probabilistic predictions to lay audiences.

[...any bayesian algorithm is also an algorithm that can be implemented for streaming...](http://koaning.io/bayesian-propto-streaming-algorithms.html)

[Inherent Trade-Offs in the Fair Determination of Risk Scores](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807v2.pdf) - explains how all algorithms have a tradeoff between fairness and accuracy.

[Automated Inference on Criminality using Face Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04135v1.pdf) - looks like [Phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology) might have some empirical support.

## Economics

[A Theory of Efficient Short-Termism](http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=318115065115116112006071070007020087017069064045069066075089119069073013022122126018022103030104056120001029126081080000114090117022094008013004024025097124116015112065073085000067011020002116008091086091104064099090012110122107114031019104025090066074&EXT=pdf). This article postulates that the owners of firms want managers to pursue short term goals in order to reduce the risk of managers engageing in rent seeking.

[A meta analysis of student evaluations](/blog_media/2016/assorted_links_nov_3_2016/Meta_analysis_of_faculty's_teaching_effectiveness_Student_evaluation_of_teaching_ratings_and_student_learning_are_not_related__student_evaluations_meta_analysis.pdf) shows that student evaluations of professors are more or less uncorrelated with teaching effectiveness. I'm not particularly surprised - I always considered student evaluations to be a measure of attractiveness, sympathy and how easy the tests are.

## Culture

[Is Empathy Necessary for Morality?](http://subcortex.com/IsEmpathyNecessaryForMoralityPrinz.pdf)

[What the hell is postmodernism?](http://www.mcmansionhell.com/post/152216735596/what-the-hell-is-postmodernism)
