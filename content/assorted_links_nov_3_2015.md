## Statistics and Computer Science

[JavaScript and fast data structures: some initial experiments](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2015/10/05/javascript-and-fast-data-structures-some-initial-experiments/)

[Why do we make statistics so hard for our students?](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2015/10/06/why-do-we-make-statistics-so-hard-for-our-students/) Discusses how basically all hypothesis tests have the same structure, and our overreliance on formulas makes that hard to see.

[An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royopensci/1/3/140216.full.pdf). This article is about plausible estimates for false discovery rates, based on the assumption that researchers use a p=0.05 cutoff value. (Hint: it's high.)

[Bayesian Reasoning and Deep Learning](http://blog.shakirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bayes_Deep.pdf). Very interesting, from one of the DeepMind guys.

[Why Do High-Frequency Traders Cancel So Many Orders?](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-08/why-do-high-frequency-traders-cancel-so-many-orders-) By Matt Levine, so more or less self recommending.
