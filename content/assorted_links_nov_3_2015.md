[Modern Art Desserts](http://amzn.to/1Qiov3T) - a very cool book which I take some inspiration from.

[Where Superforecasters Start](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/10/outside_first.html) - tl;dr; the base rate.

## Statistics and Computer Science

[JavaScript and fast data structures: some initial experiments](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2015/10/05/javascript-and-fast-data-structures-some-initial-experiments/)

[Why do we make statistics so hard for our students?](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2015/10/06/why-do-we-make-statistics-so-hard-for-our-students/) Discusses how basically all hypothesis tests have the same structure, and our overreliance on formulas makes that hard to see.

[An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royopensci/1/3/140216.full.pdf). This article is about plausible estimates for false discovery rates, based on the assumption that researchers use a p=0.05 cutoff value. (Hint: it's high.)

[Bayesian Reasoning and Deep Learning](http://blog.shakirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bayes_Deep.pdf). Very interesting, from one of the DeepMind guys.

[Why Do High-Frequency Traders Cancel So Many Orders?](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-08/why-do-high-frequency-traders-cancel-so-many-orders-) By Matt Levine, so more or less self recommending.

[A Simple Differentially Private Procedure](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2015/10/a-simple-differentially-private-procedure/). Describes how running the [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)), one can make a statistical procedure differentially private. Also, relatedly, [Differential privacy in a Bayesian setting through posterior sampling](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.1066v4.pdf) describes how computing a posterior and then *sampling* it can result in a differentially private result. This paper is *very* readable, and actually generalizes differential privacy in an interesting way.

## Economics and social science

[Sanity for Sociality: A Theory of Religion](http://thefutureprimaeval.net/sanity-for-sociality/). This is a reflection on religion, portraying it as social benefits (look how awesome Mormon life is) at the cost of some sanity. The unanswered question: "...for those of us sitting outside wishing we could be inside, but unwilling or otherwise unable to pay the sanity cost, the question arises: why do all religious, especially the good ones, require a sanity ante?"

[Closing the Black-White IQ Gap Debate](http://www.unz.com/article/closing-the-black-white-iq-gap-debate-part-2/). This is a very nice article which digs up data on black American academic performance, comparing it to African immigrant academic performance. Genetic theories of IQ predict that black Americans (genetically 10-50% European) should outperform their African counterparts. Turns out that reality behaves the opposite way. Anecdotally, this makes sense - my ex-girlfriend's (Nigerian) dad sounded like the sort to say ["Hepatitus B? Why not Hepatitis A?"](https://www.google.com/search?q=high+expectations+asian+father&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIsMjXwLHhyAIVQTU-Ch3n0wzE&biw=1735&bih=862)
