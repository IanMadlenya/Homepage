I've switched this blog over to https. Some time back a talk was given by some folks at google arguing that we should use [https everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBhZ6S0PFCY), and I believe they are correct. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) (my CDN) made it very easy - I simply created a page rule for `http://www.chrisstucchio.com/*` for https everywhere. If you run a blog you should make the same change.

If you encounter any part of this blog which is broken as a result, please let me know.
