[The Algebra and Calculus of Algebraic Data Types](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/algebra-and-calculus-of-algebraic-data-types/).

[Too Much Finance or Statistical Illusion?](http://www.piie.com/publications/pb/pb15-9.pdf). Very important econometric note: quadratic regression with any variable that rises with per capita income (e.g., doctors, finance, telephones) will cause a negative quadratic term - i.e., past a certain point, that quantity will be predicted to reduce growth.

[Functional Error Accumulation in Scala](http://longcao.org/2015/07/09/functional-error-accumulation-in-scala)

[A Dynamic Programming Solution to A/B Test Design](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2015/07/dynamic-prog-ab-test-design/). A nice article on bandit algorithms (not A/B testing strictly speaking) that almost, but doesn't quite, derive the [Gittins Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gittins_index).

[An Alternative to Null-Hypothesis Significance Tests](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1473027/pdf/nihms5428.pdf). This paper pushes *replicability* - the probability that future experiments will return results with the same sign as the existing result. An interesting way to think about it, though in my view too focused on experimental methods and not focused enough on actually explaining the world.

[What is the expectation maximization](http://ai.stanford.edu/~chuongdo/papers/em_tutorial.pdf)

[Power Laws in Venture Capital](http://reactionwheel.net/2015/06/power-laws-in-venture.html)

[Anti-technology Terrorists Attack Competing Workers](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/25/french-anti-uber-protest-turns-to-guerrilla-warfare-as-cabbies-burn-cars-attack-uber-drivers/). According to Courtney Love, the police [seem complicit](https://twitter.com/Courtney/status/614033151984205824).

[The Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics](http://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/). The Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics says that you when you observe or interact with a problem in any way, you can be blamed for it. At the very least, you are to blame for not doing more. This philosophy is very relevant to a variety of topics - e.g., minimum wages, trading with poor countries, etc. [Jaibot's blog](http://blog.jaibot.com/) is pretty interesting and has been added to my rss.

[A Cynicâ€™s Guide To Fintech](https://medium.com/bull-market/a-cynic-s-guide-to-fintech-3cd0995e0da3).

[Alex Kozinsky has written a scathing indictment of the American criminal justice system](http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/2015/06/Kozinski_Preface.pdf). tl;dr; there are lots of people who are wrongfully convicted.
