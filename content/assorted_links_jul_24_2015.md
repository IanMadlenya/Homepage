[Too Much Finance or Statistical Illusion?](http://www.piie.com/publications/pb/pb15-9.pdf). Very important econometric note: quadratic regression with any variable that rises with per capita income (e.g., doctors, finance, telephones) will cause a negative quadratic term - i.e., past a certain point, that quantity will be predicted to reduce growth.

[An Alternative to Null-Hypothesis Significance Tests](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1473027/pdf/nihms5428.pdf). This paper pushes *replicability* - the probability that future experiments will return results with the same sign as the existing result. An interesting way to think about it, though in my view too focused on experimental methods and not focused enough on actually explaining the world.
