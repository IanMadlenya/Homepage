## Math, Stats, Computer Science

[“Why Should I Trust You?” Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf)

[Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf) - a great paper on category theory, explaining connections between computation, mathematics and quantum physics.

[A Simple Explanation for the Replication Crisis](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/08/24/replication-crisis/). Great piece by Andrew Gelman.

## Economics

[Passive Investing Is Worse for Society Than Marxism](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-23/bernstein-passive-investing-is-worse-for-society-than-marxism). An interesting article which makes the argument that while Marxism at least *attempts* to optimize capital flows, passive investing does not.

## Culture

[The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dictatorship of the Small Minority](https://medium.com/@nntaled/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#.bqg1659rq) by Nassim Taleb.

[The Social Crucifixion of IOError](https://contraspin.co.nz/the-weaponising-of-social-pt1-the-crucifixion-of-ioerror/), [part 2](https://contraspin.co.nz/the-weaponising-of-social-pt-2-stomping-on-ioerrors-grave/) and [part 3](https://contraspin.co.nz/the-weaponising-of-social-part-3-the-resurrection-of-ioerror/). It's a good analysis of what I now believe to be a mobbing against Jakob Applebaum, an attack on him by some adversaries within his circles who for some reason have decided they dislike him.
