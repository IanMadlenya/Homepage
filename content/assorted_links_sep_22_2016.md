## Math, Stats, Computer Science

[“Why Should I Trust You?” Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf)

[Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf) - a great paper on category theory, explaining connections between computation, mathematics and quantum physics.

[A Simple Explanation for the Replication Crisis](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/08/24/replication-crisis/). Great piece by Andrew Gelman.

[Debugging machine learning](https://nlpers.blogspot.com/2016/08/debugging-machine-learning.html)

[Scott Alexander on tail risk](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/31/terrorists-vs-chairs-an-outlier-story/).

## Economics

[Passive Investing Is Worse for Society Than Marxism](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-23/bernstein-passive-investing-is-worse-for-society-than-marxism). An interesting article which makes the argument that while Marxism at least *attempts* to optimize capital flows, passive investing does not.

[American Exceptionalism](http://greyenlightenment.com/american-exceptionalism-8189/). Kind of contradicts my personal pessimism about the US.

[It's a long way down](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=10259). Scott Sumner (toward the end of the post) discusses how much worse poverty can be, comparing the US to Mexico, Mexico to China 2011, China 2011 to China 1997, etc.

[The Role of Headhunters in Wage Inequality: It's All About Matching](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=EEAESEM2016&paper_id=1093). Paper argues that income inequality is rising because high skilled labor markets were previously inefficient and the rich were underpaid. Now headhunters have helped the markets to clear.

## Culture

[The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dictatorship of the Small Minority](https://medium.com/@nntaled/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#.bqg1659rq) by Nassim Taleb.

[The Social Crucifixion of IOError](https://contraspin.co.nz/the-weaponising-of-social-pt1-the-crucifixion-of-ioerror/), [part 2](https://contraspin.co.nz/the-weaponising-of-social-pt-2-stomping-on-ioerrors-grave/) and [part 3](https://contraspin.co.nz/the-weaponising-of-social-part-3-the-resurrection-of-ioerror/). It's a good analysis of what I now believe to be a mobbing against Jakob Applebaum, an attack on him by some adversaries within his circles who for some reason have decided they dislike him.

I recently learned about [IQ shredders](http://www.xenosystems.net/iq-shredders/), [more](https://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/lee-kuan-yew-drains-your-brains-for-short-term-gain/) and . A truly interesting concept - cities like Singapore, Mumbai and NYC attract the smartest people, reduces their fertility to below replacement levels, and thereby reduces IQ for humans in the future.
