[The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dictatorship of the Small Minority](https://medium.com/@nntaled/the-most-intolerant-wins-the-dictatorship-of-the-small-minority-3f1f83ce4e15#.bqg1659rq) by Nassim Taleb.

[The Social Crucifixion of IOError](https://contraspin.co.nz/the-weaponising-of-social-pt1-the-crucifixion-of-ioerror/), [part 2](https://contraspin.co.nz/the-weaponising-of-social-pt-2-stomping-on-ioerrors-grave/) and [part 3](https://contraspin.co.nz/the-weaponising-of-social-part-3-the-resurrection-of-ioerror/).
