Previously I argued that some chunk of HFT is rent seeking due to the minimal tick sizes induced by the subpenny rule. It appears now that there is a proposal to the SEC to [increase the tick size](http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120620-712955.html) in order to increase market making activity. I.e., if you raise the price floor on liquidity, you'll induce an oversupply of it.
