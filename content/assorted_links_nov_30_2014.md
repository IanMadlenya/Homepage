[Multiple comparisons don't have to feel like fishing](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)

[Timeseries: Cointegration](ftp://ftp.econ.au.dk/creates/rp/14/rp14_38.pdf) - a useful overview.

[Wavelets in J](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2014/11/14/notation-as-a-tool-for-thought-wavelets-in-j/)

[Tomatoes are a subtype of vegetables](http://blog.ezyang.com/2014/11/tomatoes-are-a-subtype-of-vegetables/)

[Exactly once delivery may not be what you want](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/11/15/exactly-once.html). tl;dr; Idempotence for side effects is fucking awesome if you can make it happen.

[Seaborn](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) - a great addition to matplotlib. Very useful plotting techniques.

[Beyond power calculations: Assessing Type S (sign) and Type M (magnitude) errors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropower20.pdf)
