I recently gave a talk at [PyDelhi 2017](https://conference.pydelhi.org/). The talk was an introduction to Bayesian statistics for the average Python programmer who knows no statistics. The [slides are available here.](/pubs/slides/pydelhi_2017/slides.html). Examples included my gamble with [@lisamahapatra](https://twitter.com/lisamahapatra) as to whether Richard Spencer ever hurt anyone, how to predict disease given diagnostic tests, and [compass calibration](/blog/2016/bayesian_calibration_of_mobile_phone_compass.html).
