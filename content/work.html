I am a Data Scientist (formerly known as "Statistician") and I am currently seeking consulting work.

Things I'm good at:

- Data analysis/number crunching
- A/B testing and optimization
- Systems programming
- Functional programming

Specific programming languages I use regularly include Python, Java, Scala and Haskell. My primary data analysis frameworks are Hadoop and Numpy/Scipy, and I usually use Akka for realtime event processing ("Complex Event Processing" if you like buzzwords).

Here is my [formal resume](work/resume.pdf). I am best contacted at *stucchio@gmail.com*.

**For Recruiters:** please send me an email since I do not have time to deal with unsolicited phone calls. Please include details - I'm unlikely to respond to messages which merely request a phone call and tell me nothing about hte position being recruited for. The [resume](work/resume.pdf) here is my most current and is only available in pdf format. (It is written in LaTeX which does not provide MS Word as an output format.)
