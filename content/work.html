I'm currently a data scientist at [Patch](http://www.patch.com/).

Things I'm good at:

- Data analysis/number crunching
- A/B testing
- Systems programming
- Full stack web development
- Functional programming

Here is my [formal resume](work/resume.pdf).

If you are recruiting, please send me an email. I rarely have time to talk on the phone, particularly during working hours. The more detail you include, the more likely it is that I'll respond. In the event of an unsolicited phone call, I almost certainly will not get back to you.

The [resume](work/resume.pdf) here is my most current - if you plan to ask me to email you my most current, [click here](work/resume.pdf) instead.
