I live a strange life - due to a funny life situation, I travel regularly between India and the US. One of the starkest differences is observing how many jobs machines have taken in the wealthy US, leaving the US with a dire surplus of labor.

## A day in the life of Prashant from Gurgaon

Introducing Prashant, a software architect. Prashant wakes up early, heads to a nearby gym, and works out with his personal trainer. After he gets back from the gym, his wife and family are awake, and they all eat a light breakfast prepared by their cook. Prashant lives in Gurgaon, but works in Pitampura - 1.5 hours away. He doesn't want to lose productivity, so he tethers his laptop to his phone and updates JIRA tickets while his driver worries about the road.

Prashant's wife Aishwarya is also a working professional, so she drops her children off at the creche (Hinglish word for day care) where she stores her children while not in use.  After getting home from work, Prashant and Aishwarya are tired and don't want to cook. So they normally eat the food their cook prepared - tonight it's a spicy paneer chili. After dinner they take a walk. Prashant develops a cravine for paan - a delightful contrast to the oily and spicy paneer chili he ate before. So he stops by one of the local paan-walas working by the side of the road. Aishwarya also buys a single cigarette.

Prashant and Aishwarya then walk home, enjoying their minor indulgences.

## A day in the life of Mike from California

Introducing Mike from California, a software salesman extrordinaire. Like Prashant, Mike also wakes up early, chugs some brotein and then heads to his a crossfit box where starts a set of deadlifts. Suddenly he hears a disembodied voice - "Don't bend your back on the deadlift, Mike!" The AI critiques his form and guides him through a personalized workout.

After his workout he goes back home to his kitchen. "Tea, Earl Grey, Hot" he says, and with some hissing his kitchen-bot prepares him tea. Mike then takes out his phone, orders an egg white omellete, and a few minutes later the bot has produced it. After eating, Mike heads for the shower while the cleaning bot rapidly scurries out of his way.

Mike then takes out his phone and orders an Uber. The self driving Uber shows up and takes him to his office. When he gets to the office, he notices his coworker Katrina watching her children on the nannycam. He sees a baby sleeping in the arms of a large, cuddly furry humanoid shape - Katrina's friendly NannyBot. It looks like a stuffed toy, but the AI inside keeps her children very safe.

After heading home, Mike goes out for a run - he likes to separate his cardio and strength training. As he is coming back from his run, he stops by one of the many food stalls on the way back. "Give me 2 fish tacos, less oil" he asks. He then taps his phone to the terminal to pay. A slightly distorted voice replies to him - "Si senor, tres minutos." Apparently the speakers on the taco-bot need a little adjustment, but three minutes later the bot hands him delicious fish tacos.

Mike then heads home, ready for bed.

## ...

My Indian readers probably see quite a bit of themselves in the story of Prashant. But my American readers probably recognize that the story of Mike from California is pure science fiction.

In the US, self driving cars are currently research projects owned by Google and Tesla. Mike can't afford an Uber every day, so he needs to drive himself to work. There is no kitchen bot, cleaning bot or taco bot. Katrina quit work to be with her children - child care is too expensive and only very highly productive women can afford it.

Machines didn't steal these jobs. These jobs just don't get done.

This is not really what you'd expect if there is a surplus of labor. Isn't a surplus a situation where we have so much supply of something that we just don't consume it all? Yet in the real world, we find ourselves in a situation where we desperately want more labor to be performed.

## Where did the jobs go?

Lets think about some examples of jobs that get done in India, but don't get done in the US. It's easy to imagine that a paan-wala might not get much business in the US - lots of Americans just don't like paan. But what about the paan-wala's other line of business, selling single cigarettes?

In the US, we actually do have a few such people. In 2014, an American (alleged) cigarette wala became quite famous for a little while. His name was Eric Garner. Unfortunately Eric Garner didn't become famous for selling cigarettes very well, he became famous because the police choked him to death while he told them [11 times that he couldn't breath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpGxagKOkv8). (Warning: that's a link to police executing a guy for no good reason.)

Perhaps people in the US can't find jobs as cigarette sellers because they don't want to be killed.
