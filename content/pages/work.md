I am a Data Scientist (formerly known as "Statistician") and I am currently the director of data science at [Wingify](http://wingify.com/), the makers of [VWO.com](https://vwo.com/) and [Pushcrew](https://pushcrew.com/).

Things I'm good at:

- Data analysis/number crunching
- A/B testing and optimization
- Systems programming
- Functional programming

Specific programming languages I use regularly include Python, Java, Scala and Haskell. My primary data analysis frameworks are Hadoop and Numpy/Scipy, and I usually use Akka for realtime event processing.

Here is my [formal resume](work/resume.pdf). I am best contacted at *stucchio@gmail.com*.

**For Recruiters:** I don't have time for unsolicited phone calls - send me an email. Include enough details in your email to allow me to quickly evaluate whether the position you are recruiting for is a good fit - this includes a detailed description of the role, company name, and a ballpark on compensation. The [resume](work/resume.pdf) here is my most current and is only available in pdf format (LaTeX doesn't output to Word).

**For the curious:** The resume was made with latex, specifically the [moderncv](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv/?lang=en) package. Source is [here](work/resume.tex).
