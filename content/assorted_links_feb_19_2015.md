[Liberal Bias in Social Psychology](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rabble-rouser/201310/liberal-bias-in-social-psychology-personal-experience-ii). Interesting paper, and interesting what they needed to do to publish it: "We could not get this published.  It was rejected at two separate journals.  Finally, we decided to bag every mention of liberals being more biased than conservatives, and resubmitted it to another journal.  This time, it was accepted." See a also this [article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rabble-rouser/201309/liberal-bias-in-social-psychology-personal-experience-i) on the topic.
