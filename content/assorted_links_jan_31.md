[How to conquer tensorphobia](http://jeremykun.com/2014/01/17/how-to-conquer-tensorphobia/)

[A Scala Corrections Library](http://www.slideshare.net/extempore/a-scala-corrections-library)

[On retiring the idea of falsifiability in science](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25322). Also see [this article](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1653) on the same topic.

[Nassim Taleb writes an idiotic article](http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25401) advocating that we should stop using standard deviations. Pointless to read. But [John Mount's takedown](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/01/use-standard-deviation-not-mad-about-mad/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=use-standard-deviation-not-mad-about-mad) is useful.

[For Hire! Bangalore Rickshaw](http://vimeo.com/43397805). It's a nice video that captures the auto experience very well, for those who've never rode one.
