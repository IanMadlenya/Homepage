[NEJM suggests it's rude to use an author's own data to prove them wrong](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1516564). Um, that's not how science works.

[The Real Tragedy in Flint](http://gregbranchwords.com/2016/01/17/the-real-tragedy-in-flint/).

[An anonymous response to dangerous FOSS Codes of Conduct](https://4fa6134ddde55ae0092b69e1eb287d2840301d0a.googledrive.com/host/0B6kjFNJtv3yzUjY4M21QenJzdGc/)

[A quantitative analysis of free speech](http://anonymousmugwump.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/the-empirics-of-free-speech-and_29.html?m=1).

[An unconditional increase in teacher salary has no beneficial effect](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~kamurali/papers/Working%20Papers/Double%20for%20Nothing%20%28Current%20WP%29.pdf).

[Fools Gold: An Illustrated Critique of Differential Privacy](http://www.jetlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bambauer_Final.pdf) and [On Syntactic Anonymity and Differential Privacy](http://www.openu.ac.il/personal_sites/tamirtassa/download/journals/anonymity_dp.pdf) are both good critiques of the practical usefulness of differential privacy.

[Class Systems in America](http://siderea.livejournal.com/1260265.html?format=light), and relatedly [Castes of the United States](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/05/castes-of-united-states.html) and [The 3-Ladder System of Social Class in the US](https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/09/09/the-3-ladder-system-of-social-class-in-the-u-s/). Michael O. Church and Mencius Moldbug are mostly agreeing on something.

Sometime back Paul Graham wrote about [a way to detect bias](http://www.paulgraham.com/bias.html), namely by measuring the relative ability of people who are *selected*. I.e., if women are discriminated against, they should outperform men. I did a little more [math on that topic](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2015/paul_grahams_bias_test.html). Now Jonathan Adler is using this idea to [investigate whether conservative law professors are discriminated against](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/01/revisiting-whether-conservative-and-libertarian-law-professors-are-more-productive-than-their-peers/). Apparently conservative law professors are significantly more productive than their liberal counterparts, suggesting that there may be possible discrimination.
