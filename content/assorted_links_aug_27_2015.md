# Computing

[Asymptotic Improvement of Computations over Free Monads](http://www.janis-voigtlaender.eu/papers/AsymptoticImprovementOfComputationsOverFreeMonads.pdf). Nice hack, though I think it applies mainly to lazy languages.

I've gotten into [Count Min Sketch](https://7797b024-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/countminsketch/cm-latin.pdf) lately. It's a neat probabilistic algorithm for counting, and it has the nice property that you can compute inner products with it. More [papers](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D12-1100) on the [topic](http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdf).

[Searching 20 GB/sec: Systems Engineering Before Algorithms](http://blog.scalyr.com/2014/05/searching-20-gbsec-systems-engineering-before-algorithms/) - an oldie but a goodie about brute force log search.

# Economics and Social Sciences

[The Market for Silver Bullets ](http://iang.org/papers/market_for_silver_bullets.html) - about selling computer security. Apparently security markets are highly inefficient - neither lemon nor lime markets, since both buyer and seller can be clueless.

[Evolution is Not Relevant to Sex Differences in Humans Because I Want it That Way! Evidence for the Politicization of Human Evolutionary Psychology](http://www.evostudies.org/pdf/GeherVol2Iss1.pdf). It's a small sample size, so take with an appropriate grain of salt, but it presents evidence that much of the distaste for evolutionary psychology is solely about disliking the implications for sex differences in humans.

[Great article on how to make commuter rail efficient.](https://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2015/07/26/why-labor-efficiency-is-important/) Hint: eliminate conductors.

# Politics

[The Rule of Law in the Regulatory State](http://johnhttp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/cmencyc.pdfhcochrane.blogspot.in/2015/08/rule-of-law-in-regulatory-state.html). This is a fantastic article by John Cochrane discussing how the modern regulatory state has more or less eliminated the rule of law. The general idea is that many projects require pre-approval from regulatory agencies; these agencies use vaguely defined rules and arbitrary delays in order to hinder political opponents. This article provides a lot of detail to support various claims that neoreactionary types make.

[Antiracism - our flawed new religion](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/27/antiracism-our-flawed-new-religion.html).

# Biology

[“Ethnic Genetic Interests” Do Not Exist (Neither Does Group Selection)](https://jaymans.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/ethnic-genetic-interests-do-not-exist-neither-does-group-selection/). It's unfortunate that he needs to debunk this, and that such nonsense is becoming so widespread in certain contrarian spheres.
