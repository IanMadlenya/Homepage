[Beeple-crap](http://www.beeple-crap.com/) - it's amazing simply how much this guy has produced. It gets better over time.

Very important! [A scone is not a biscuit](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/article/scone-is-not-a-biscuit).

[Procedural Brutalism](http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/procedural-brutalism.html)

[Very interesting article on the Vatican](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/14/holy-orders-letter-from-the-vatican-alexander-stille), Ratzinger and Francis.

# Computing and Mathematics

[Castra](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2015/08/28/Storage/) - a much more efficient data storage format than csv. On [github](https://github.com/blaze/castra). Would love to see how this compares to HDF5.

[Do Artificial Reinforcement-Learning Agents Matter Morally?](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8233v1.pdf) I sure hope not, because I shut them off all the time.

[The Frequentist Argument against the Significance Test](http://bayesfactor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/the-frequentist-argument-against.html) and [part 2](http://bayesfactor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/the-frequentist-case-against.html).

[How do you know if your model is going to work?](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2015/09/isyourmodelgoingtowork/) A nice overview on testing models.

[Nock, Hoon, etc. for Non-Vulcans (Why Urbit Matters)](https://popehat.com/2013/12/06/nock-hoon-etc-for-non-vulcans-why-urbit-matters/). After reading this motivation document, take a look at [Urbit: an operating function](http://urbit.org/preview/~2015.9.25).

[Vuvuzela: Scalable Private Messaging Resistant to Traffic Analysis](http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp15/current/2015-Monterey/printable/136-hooff.pdf). Discusses using differential privacy to ensure that an adversary cannot determine whether Alice is messaging Bob or not. (Compare to encryption, which only prevents an adversary from identifying the contents of the message.)

# Economics and Social Sciences

Deadly Caution - apparently the American [FDA's conservativism about approving drugs is costing many lives](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/08/is-the-fda-too-conservative-or-too-aggressive.html).

[Advice to a young social scientist](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2015/08/28/advice-to-a-young-social-scientist/) - learn statistics.

[The Decline in Labor's Share of U.S. Income](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/09/the_decline_in_1.html) is due primarily to a methodology change in measuring labor income. Specifically, until 2001, proprieter income was treated as being 80% labor income, but now it's less than 50%. Also, [Pay/Productivity gap graphs are nonsense](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=30585).

[Cognitive Capitalism: The Effect of Cognitive Ability on Wealth, as Mediated Through Scientific Achievement and Economic Freedom](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3c4TxciNeJZSXBLaS12QmVIU1k/view). An interesting paper providing correlational evidence that wealth is primarily the result of highly intelligent people combined with economic freedom.

[Willful Paranoia: The Classic Excuse](https://popehat.com/2015/09/16/willful-paranoia-the-classic-excuse-for-willful-paranoia-istandwithahmed/). Probably the best commentary I've seen on #istandwithahmed.

[Police have the highest rate of domestic violence, the NFL is well below the national average.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/09/10/1420117/-Police-officers-have-a-rate-of-domestic-violence-at-least-300-higher-than-active-players-in-the-NFL)

[Lessons from Gurgaon](https://mason.gmu.edu/~atabarro/Lessons%20from%20Gurgaon.pdf). This is a great article describing how Gurgaon grew to be one of the largest voluntary (almost entirely privately developed) cities in the world, and in part why Faridabad did not. A very important point in the article is monopolistic vs serial corruption - a monopolistic corrupt overlord has the incentive to choose a Laffer-curve maximizing tax revenue, while multiple corrupt parties will kill the goose laying the golden egg. A great example supporting the neoreactionary case in favor of a single dictator.

[Our (US) Bizarre System of Taxing Capital](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/09/our_bizarre_sys.html).

# Biology

[Eugenics Ready](https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/05/eugenics-ready/). Argues that (non-forcible) eugenics is coming, and there isn't much we can do to stop it. It also discusses the possible social cohesion issues caused by a minority of the population adopting positive eugenics - a self-selecting caste of high quality humans. I'd argue that the real world suggests this isn't such a huge issue; Jews in the US, Parsis and Gujus in India, Chinese in south-east Asia are already such a "caste", and it's hardly disastrous.
