[Awesome monsters](http://johnkenn.blogspot.com/)

[A Jedi's Path to Jihad](http://decider.com/2015/12/11/the-radicalization-of-luke-skywalker-a-jedis-path-to-jihad/)

## Computer science and Statistics

[Probabilistic Integration](http://andrewgelman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1512.00933.pdf) - a really nice paper describing a new way of doing numerical integration.

## Economics and Social Science

[Smith meet Jones](http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2015/12/smith-meet-jones.html) - a nice article about how improving quality of institutions could even benefit frontier (leading) economies like the US, both in terms of level and growth rate.

[Your Landlord is a Drag on Growth](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-12-04/your-landlord-hurts-growth-and-aggravates-inequality).

[The Surprising Truth About Stereotypes](http://quillette.com/2015/12/04/rebellious-scientist-surprising-truth-about-stereotypes/) and a [somewhat more academic discussion](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jussim/unbearable%20accuracy%20of%20stereotypes.pdf). The academic discussion is quite interesting - for example, ethnic and gender stereotypes are vastly more accurate than social psychology hypothesis (see table 10.4, page 222).

[Gender Differences in Subjective Well Being](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/284736627_Gender_Differences_in_Subjective_Well-Being_and_Their_Relationships_with_Gender_Equality) - purports to show that an increased number of women in the workforce reduces women's happiness relative to men. Obvious caveats about happiness research apply.

[On Concentrated Poverty and it's Effects on Educational Outcomes](https://randomcriticalanalysis.wordpress.com/2015/05/16/on-concentrated-poverty-and-its-effects-on-academic-outcomes/) - an interesting blog post which analyzes some California data to determine how much of racial achievement gaps is explained by poverty. Answer: not a lot.

[Regulatory Problems in Cancer Research](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2015/12/06/regulatory-problems-with-cancer-research/)

[Scott Alexander's analysis](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/08/book-review-hive-mind/) of Garret Jones' [Hive Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804785961/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0804785961&linkCode=as2&tag=christuc-20&linkId=SXCJHYURCN5Y3TWB). Notably, Alexander finds a few interesting flaws in the theory and asks some important questions - e.g., what if high IQ colonial overlords rule a low IQ nation? Also linked by Alexander is quite interesting, the [Smart Fraction](http://lagriffedulion.f2s.com/sft.htm) theory and [part 2](http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/sft2.htm).

[Robin Hanson](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/12/tax-coastal-cities.html) discusses a talk by Schelling, which remarks on the fact that most of the infrastructure that will be underwater due to climate change *has not yet been built*. He proposes taxing coastal development in order to prevent such infrastructure from being built and encourage people to move inland.

[Why education does not fix poverty](http://www.demos.org/blog/12/2/15/why-education-does-not-fix-poverty)

## Culture

[The Hugging Will Continue until Morale Improves](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-hugging-will-continue-until-morale-improves/). In which Jeff Atwood suggests you should (and he will) adopt a useless code of conduct in order to emotionally manipulate women into feeling safe. Actually solving their problem is useless because "quickest way to turn a child's frustration into a screaming, explosive tantrum is to try to fix their problem". Relatedly: ["even if these so called “statistics” beared any resemblance to reality, it would be still be wholly inappropriate to even speak of such things "](https://medium.com/@Levondia/the-most-racist-among-us-is-free-speech-really-a-right-worth-protecting-anymore-a057771bb016#.x4ii1jghh). At least a few folks [see the crazy](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/06/brown-university-professor-denounces-mccarthy-witch-hunts.html).

[Popehat calls out bullshit on the gun "debate"](https://popehat.com/2015/12/07/talking-productively-about-guns/). Choice quote:

> Me: I don't want to take away dog owners' rights. But we need to do something about Rottweilers.
> You: So what do you propose?
> Me: I just think that there should be some sort of training or restrictions on owning an attack dog.
> You: Wait. What's an "attack dog?"
> Me: You know what I mean. Like military dogs.
> You: Huh? Rottweilers aren't military dogs. In fact "military dogs" isn't a thing. You mean like German Shepherds?
> Me: Don't be ridiculous. Nobody's trying to take away your German Shepherds. But civilians shouldn't own fighting dogs.
> You: I have no idea what dogs you're talking about now.
> Me: You're being both picky and obtuse. You know I mean hounds.
> You: What the fuck.
