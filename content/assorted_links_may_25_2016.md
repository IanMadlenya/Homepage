## Computer science and math

[Bots won't replace apps - better apps will](http://dangrover.com/blog/2016/04/20/bots-wont-replace-apps.html). Argues that the main reason for the rise of WeChat and the like is that mobile OS makers aren't really meeting user needs.

[Write Papers like a Modern Scientist](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/04/21/writing/)

[CDNs aren't just for caching](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/29/cdns-arent-just-for-caching/).

Jeremy Kun [explains the SVD](https://jeremykun.com/2016/04/18/singular-value-decomposition-part-1-perspectives-on-linear-algebra/) and (along the way) how data scientists look at matrices.

[Simpson's Paradox](https://growthecon.com/blog/Decomposition/).

## Econ and social sci

[Countries with Higher Levels of Gender Equality Show Larger National Sex Differences in Mathematics Anxiety and Relatively Lower Parental Mathematics Valuation for Girls](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0153857).

[The Uberization of Banking](http://www.wsj.com/article_email/the-uberization-of-banking-1461967266-lMyQjAxMTE2NzMzMDQzNzA3Wj) discusses a non-bank lender who discovered that if you aren't a bank, you are permitted to lend to people with a high probability of repayment. [John Cochrane](http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2016/04/equity-financed-banking.html) comments on it. From Cochrane:
>Yes, bank "safety" regulations demand that banks purposely lend to people that one can pretty clearly see will not pay it back, and demand that they do not lend money to people that one can pretty clearly see will pay it back...
>In today's rather rule-free environment, the CFPB -- or Department of Justice -- might just discover it doesn't like the demographics of Stanford MBAs as target borrowers.

## Culture

[Mukbang and haul videos](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/mukbang-and-hauls-the-rise-of-super-indulgent-eating-and-shopping-videos/) - super indulgent eating/shopping videos. I just don't understand this stuff, but I want to at least be aware of it. Where can I get updates about such things?

[Noir Shanghai](http://www.designboom.com/art/amey-kandalgaonkar-dark-deco-shanghai-04-29-2016/). Simply beautiful.

[Why the NRA hates Smart Guns](http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/30/why-the-nra-hates-smart-guns/). This is a surprisingly good article, particularly for Tech Crunch.

[The Long Term Consequencs of Teacher Discretion in Grading](http://papers.nber.org/tmp/97077-w22207.pdf). Apparently giving students good (unearned) grades has far reaching and beneficial effects - it suggests a beneficial signalling effect *within the school system* rather than future labor markets. Very interesting.
