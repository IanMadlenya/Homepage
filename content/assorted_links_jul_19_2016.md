## Culture

First of all, since I'm posting a little on Brexit, let me disclose my bets. On the first trading day after Brexit, I went long Britain and long EU. Also bought some SPY at a discount.

As an American splitting time between the US and India, I know fuck all about Brexit. This [interview with Dominic Cummings](http://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2016/01/out-campaign) makes a good case for it. Here's a Cathederal economist [laying out a nearly Moldbuggian](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brexit-democratic-failure-for-uk-by-kenneth-rogoff-2016-06?referrer=/IWqT24P7A6) case against democracy in the wake of Brexit.

[Brexit and the Moral Vision of Nationhood](https://mereorthodoxy.com/political-social-earthquake-brexit-future-britain/). This is a great article explaining provincialism, in particular how it relates to Britain. I found it enlightening since I'm not the sort of person who has any provincialist feelings. I expect one day to leave the US (I think she has structural problems that won't be fixed) and never return, and for me emotionally this is like throwing away a pair of shoes that are worn out.

[How Behavioral Economics Undermines the Enlightenment](https://fee.org/articles/how-behavioral-econ-undermines-the-enlightenment/). It's an interesting article, but the problem with it is that this doesn't make behavioral econ incorrect.

[The United States of South India](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/united-states-south-india-can-southern-collective-get-us-better-deal-delhi-46501) - strong advocacy for south Indian secession, though it changes course at the end.
