[An Homage to London Brutalism](http://www.archdaily.com/572150/an-homage-to-london-brutalism-by-thomas-danthony-and-michael-abrahamson/)

[Multiple comparisons don't have to feel like fishing](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)

[How Naive AB Testing Goes Wrong and How to Fix It](http://ewulczyn.github.io/How_Naive_AB_Testing_Goes_Wrong/). Nice to see that someone is using a proper [decision rule](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2014/bayesian_ab_decision_rule.html). Note: my conflict of interest is obvious to anyone who reads the articles.

[Timeseries: Cointegration](ftp://ftp.econ.au.dk/creates/rp/14/rp14_38.pdf) - a useful overview.

[Beyond power calculations: Assessing Type S (sign) and Type M (magnitude) errors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropower20.pdf)

[Seaborn](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) - a great addition to matplotlib. Very useful plotting techniques.

[Wavelets in J](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2014/11/14/notation-as-a-tool-for-thought-wavelets-in-j/)

[Focusing Behavioral Economics on Development Professionals](http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.in/2014/12/focusing-behavioral-economics-on.html). This article makes a *very* important point. Behavioral economics is often used to justify assorted paternalistic policies devised by academic experts. But it turns out the experts are subject to very similar biases. Oops.

[Exactly once delivery may not be what you want](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/11/15/exactly-once.html). tl;dr; Idempotence for side effects is fucking awesome if you can make it happen.

[New uses for shipping containers](http://www.archdaily.com/570300/designers-explore-an-entirely-new-use-for-shipping-containers-in-seoul-s-design-district/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ArchDaily+%28ArchDaily%29)

[Economists Are Almost Inhumanly Impartial](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/12/economists-are-almost-inhumanly-impartial)

Uber exec suggests [hiring reporters to report on reporters who report on Uber](http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists). I understand why Buzzfeed is selfishly against this, but I don't understand why he apologized.

Freddy Deboer discusses [Free Speech Rights and Ability](http://fredrikdeboer.com/2014/04/18/free-speech-rights-and-ability/).

Scott Alexander on [Framing for light instead of heat](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/03/framing-for-light-instead-of-heat/). I have a half-written post on causality, but now I need to mostly defer to him on this topic.

[Is Preventative Medicine it's own Health Risk?](http://aeon.co/magazine/health/is-preventive-medicine-its-own-health-risk/)

The [Non-Libertarian Police Department](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/nlpd-non-libertarian-police-department/360224/?single_page=true).

Weekly anti-intellectualism: [The smart against the dumb](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/11/the_smart_again.html). See also [Noah Smith decides to kick a nerd to make women like him.](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-11-21/economics-is-a-dismal-science-for-women). [Republican writes about bullying in feminism](http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/13/the-waronnerds-how-far-left-feminists-and-the-media-created-gamergate/) - to prove him wrong, [feminists mock his appearance](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/11/14/gamergates-new-champion-is-a-wax-replica-of-patrick-bateman-who-thinks-gamers-are-a-bunch-of-dateless-nerds/). Finally, [Freddy Deboer on mood affiliation](http://fredrikdeboer.com/2014/11/28/one-thing-ive-learned/).
