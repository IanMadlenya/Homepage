I've written a blog post describing the testing philosophy of SmartStats, VWO's new Bayesian powered A/B testing engine. In it, I discuss the difference between *hypothesis testing* (with the goal of finding truth) and *making good decisions* (with the goal of maximizing revenue). [Go check it out](https://vwo.com/blog/smartstats-testing-for-truth/) on the VWO blog. Obvious disclaimer: I work for Wingify/VWO.
