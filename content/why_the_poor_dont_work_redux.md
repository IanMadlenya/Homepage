About 3 years ago, I posted a [blog post](/blog/2011/why_the_poor_dont_work.html) arguing that the poor don't work due to economic rationality. This was just me playing around with the data and trying to see what I could come up with.

My conclusion back then: by graphing consumption vs income, it turns out that whether you earn $0 or $20k, your *consumption* is more or less the same. If utility is a monotonic function of consumption, then this means that people who's labor income will lie between $0 and $20k will have no incentive to work. The data I had is hardly perfect - it's just broad aggregates. I don't know where to get a data set which excludes students, the disabled, etc.

Anyway, I forgot about that blog post. It went semi-viral today, so I decided to revisit the topic. Turns out that about a year after I posted it, the CBO issued a report more or less agreeing with it. They compare *disposable income* to *income* (rather than *consumption* to income), but the idea is similar.

Turns out that my rough guesstimates were in the right ballpark. Here is [John Cochrane](http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/taxes-and-cliffs.html) blogging about it. More shockingly, the graphs he shows include cliffs - there are places where earning $1 more can cause you to lose hundreds of dollars in disposable income.
