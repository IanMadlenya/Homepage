[Modern Art Desserts](http://amzn.to/1Qiov3T) - a very cool book which I take some inspiration from.

[Where Superforecasters Start](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/10/outside_first.html) - tl;dr; the base rate.

## Statistics and Computer Science

[JavaScript and fast data structures: some initial experiments](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2015/10/05/javascript-and-fast-data-structures-some-initial-experiments/)

[Why do we make statistics so hard for our students?](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2015/10/06/why-do-we-make-statistics-so-hard-for-our-students/) Discusses how basically all hypothesis tests have the same structure, and our overreliance on formulas makes that hard to see.

[An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royopensci/1/3/140216.full.pdf). This article is about plausible estimates for false discovery rates, based on the assumption that researchers use a p=0.05 cutoff value. (Hint: it's high.)

[Bayesian Reasoning and Deep Learning](http://blog.shakirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bayes_Deep.pdf). Very interesting, from one of the DeepMind guys.

[Why Do High-Frequency Traders Cancel So Many Orders?](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-08/why-do-high-frequency-traders-cancel-so-many-orders-) By Matt Levine, so more or less self recommending.

[A Simple Differentially Private Procedure](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2015/10/a-simple-differentially-private-procedure/). Describes how running the [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)), one can make a statistical procedure differentially private. Also, relatedly, [Differential privacy in a Bayesian setting through posterior sampling](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.1066v4.pdf) describes how computing a posterior and then *sampling* it can result in a differentially private result. This paper is *very* readable, and actually generalizes differential privacy in an interesting way.

[Everything I Needed to Know (About Publication Bias), I Learned In (Pre-) Kindergarten](https://codeandculture.wordpress.com/2015/11/06/everything-i-needed-to-know-about-publication-bias-i-learned-in-pre-kindergarten/)

[Measuring Polymorphism in Python Programs](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2820000/2816717/p114-aakerblom.pdf?ip=66.108.92.115&id=2816717&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&CFID=728462494&CFTOKEN=99470396&__acm__=1446998015_297d0e1a4ba615b86108ff14e60c7a4e)

## Economics and social science

[Sanity for Sociality: A Theory of Religion](http://thefutureprimaeval.net/sanity-for-sociality/). This is a reflection on religion, portraying it as social benefits (look how awesome Mormon life is) at the cost of some sanity. The unanswered question: "...for those of us sitting outside wishing we could be inside, but unwilling or otherwise unable to pay the sanity cost, the question arises: why do all religious, especially the good ones, require a sanity ante?"

[Closing the Black-White IQ Gap Debate](http://www.unz.com/article/closing-the-black-white-iq-gap-debate-part-2/). This is a very nice article which digs up data on black American academic performance, comparing it to African immigrant academic performance. Genetic theories of IQ predict that black Americans (genetically 10-50% European) should outperform their African counterparts. Turns out that reality behaves the opposite way. Anecdotally, this makes sense - my ex-girlfriend's (Nigerian) dad sounded like the sort to say ["Hepatitus B? Why not Hepatitis A?"](https://www.google.com/search?q=high+expectations+asian+father&es_sm=93&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIsMjXwLHhyAIVQTU-Ch3n0wzE&biw=1735&bih=862)

[Anatomy of a ‘liberal’: Indian liberals do not offer solutions, they use the term as a class marker](http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/The-underage-optimist/anatomy-of-a-liberal-indian-liberals-do-not-offer-solutions-they-use-the-term-as-a-class-marker/). Some very spot on observations, which also apply in modified form to the US. I'm amazed that I'm linking to Chetan Bhagat. Related thoughts about the US b [Freddie Deboer](http://fredrikdeboer.com/2015/11/09/getting-past-the-coalition-of-the-cool/).

[Living the Good Life? Mortality and Hospital Utilization Patterns in the Old Order Amish](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051560) This study compares lifespans among Old Order Amish (the anti-technology folks) and regular white people, and discovers that life expectancy increases are unlikely to be caused by large amounts of medical system usage. The Amish live longer than others.

[If I was devising a Panics and Bubbles course...](https://longandvariable.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/if-i-was-devising-a-panics-and-bubbles-course/) A nice reading list about panics, bubbles, and other irrational market behavior.

[Why Education](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/02/why_education_i.html) - Tyler Cowen comes up with a novel theory why education is productive, but which seems almost indistinguishable from the signalling theory. I still believe the [Sheepskin Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)) is better predicted by the signalling theory than Cowen's theory, but it is nice to see a new idea out there.

## Culture

[A Modest Proposal for Renewed Imperialism](http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2015/11/a-modest-proposal-for-renewed-imperialism.html). Big idea: Nigerians think Finland is awesome and want to move there. It's not because of the beautiful weather or scenery - it's because of the governance and social technology. So rather than moving the people, why not move the borders?

[Scary Halloween costumes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/11/07/administrators-defending-student-free-speech-apparently-reason-for-dismissal-according-to-some-yale-students/). Apparently a college administrator wrote an email to students saying that if a halloween costume is too scary you can just close your eyes, and that she isn't the costume police. Now the students are trying to get her fired. I am not making this up. Freddie Deboer discusses in [It’s my job to take college students seriously](http://fredrikdeboer.com/2015/11/07/its-my-job-to-take-college-students-seriously/)

[A discussion of the costs of migration](http://thosewhocansee.blogspot.hk/2015/10/crashing-gates-crash-course.html), specifically Syrian and fake Syrian economic migrants to Europe. I generally lean in an open borders direction, but I don't think we should ignore the costs of such an approach. We also shouldn't ignore the fact that a large chunk of the "Syrian refugees" are probably neither Syrian nor refugees. This article also suggests that a big chunk of the problem is an unwillingness to enforce non-migratory laws (e.g., anti-rape laws) against migrants, and the fact that many migrants are seeking welfare. My preferred model of migration would be to provide 30 days of bland food and a bed for migrants, anything beyond that requires getting a job and paying for it themselves. And if anyone causes trouble (e.g. running a brothel, or preying on other migrants), the result is immediate and permanent deportation.

[Servants without Masters](http://thefutureprimaeval.net/servants-without-masters/) - interesting discussion on the difference between having impersonal and institutional servants (Handy/Uber/etc) and a single human personal servant.
