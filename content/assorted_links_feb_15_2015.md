The [Kafkatrap](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2122) - when the act of demanding a definition of X that can be consequentially checked and falsified proves you are X.

Over the past 15-30k years, [dogs and wolves diverged evolutionarily](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2012/04/30/dogs-but-not-wolves-use-humans-as-tools/). The net result is significant cognitive differences - dogs now interact with humans socially and solve problems using the humans as tools.

[Notes on Boundaries](http://www.moreright.net/notes-on-boundaries/) - an excellent article describing how forming boundaries is important. This line of thinking is one of the strongest arguments against immigration which I'm aware of. But a strange fact is that most arguments against immigration, including this one, could be also be applied in favor of (racial, in-country) segregation, ala American Jim Crow. Strangely, I've never heard an immigration opponent actually state that if blacks crossed that cutoff, they'd favor segregation also. This article by Nyan Sandwich is interesting because it's one of the few such arguments which actually hints in that direction.
