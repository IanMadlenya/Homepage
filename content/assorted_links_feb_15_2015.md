[The Tail at Scale](http://blog.acolyer.org/2015/01/15/the-tail-at-scale/). Great article about strategies to reduce latency and increase reliability in distributed systems.

[Lambda Architecture](http://lambda-architecture.net/). I may have posted this before, but I keep coming back to it.

Using [Edgeworth series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgeworth_series) to [approximate random inequalities](http://www.johndcook.com/edgeworth.pdf). Super cool.

[Build on Sand](http://www.harvarddesignmagazine.org/issues/39/built-on-sand-singapore-and-the-new-state-of-risk). Great article about how Singapore is importing sand to build new territory. Personally, I'm also very interested in simply building on the water - floating developments, ala seasteading.

Scott Alexander [debunks some silly claims](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/24/perceptions-of-required-ability-act-as-a-proxy-for-actual-required-ability-in-explaining-the-gender-gap/). Specifically, a recent article claims that perceptions of high innate ability requirements is correlated with fewer women in tech. Scott Alexander shows that *actual* high innate ability requirements is more strongly correlated, so perceptions are probably tracking reality. See also Scott's [comment](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/24/perceptions-of-required-ability-act-as-a-proxy-for-actual-required-ability-in-explaining-the-gender-gap/#comment-176368) on why IQ deniers are dangerous.

The [Kafkatrap](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=2122) - when the act of demanding a definition of X that can be consequentially checked and falsified proves you are X.

Over the past 15-30k years, [dogs and wolves diverged evolutionarily](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2012/04/30/dogs-but-not-wolves-use-humans-as-tools/). The net result is significant cognitive differences - dogs now interact with humans socially and solve problems using the humans as tools.

[Notes on Boundaries](http://www.moreright.net/notes-on-boundaries/) - an excellent article describing how forming boundaries is important. This line of thinking is one of the strongest arguments against immigration which I'm aware of. But a strange fact is that most arguments against immigration, including this one, could be also be applied in favor of (racial, in-country) segregation, ala American Jim Crow. Strangely, I've never heard an immigration opponent actually state that if blacks crossed that cutoff, they'd favor segregation. This article by Nyan Sandwich is interesting because it's one of the few such arguments which actually hints in that direction.

This is a very strange article on [what it takes to get into technology](https://medium.com/@GRardB/techs-high-barrier-to-entry-for-the-underprivileged-da254356547d). In short, the article discusses how an underprivileged kid (a non-Asian minority, if you care about such things) needed to a) attend some free events and b) get internet at home. Along the way, the kid receives a free laptop, free instruction, not to mention all sorts of free info on the internet. When he's ready to look for a job, he needs to put a code portfolio on a [free website](https://github.com). You'll never guess the title of the article.
