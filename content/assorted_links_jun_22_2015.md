[On the hazards of significance testing. Part 2: the false discovery rate, or how not to make a fool of yourself with P values](http://www.dcscience.net/2014/03/24/on-the-hazards-of-significance-testing-part-2-the-false-discovery-rate-or-how-not-to-make-a-fool-of-yourself-with-p-values/)

[Hands-Free Kafka Replication: A Lesson in Operational Simplicity](http://blog.confluent.io/2015/04/07/hands-free-kafka-replication-a-lesson-in-operational-simplicity/). Self-recommending.

This is a [great essay](http://www.moreright.net/anonymity-and-the-right/) by Michael Anissimov discussing why people who know an unpopular secret about the world should publicly tell the world that secret. It's certainly discouraged by our anti-intellectual culture, however. Toward that end: I publicly state that I find neoreactionary types to be the most insightful political thinkers today. Among other things,

[The Tragedy of Light](http://thefutureprimaeval.net/the-tragedy-of-light/) - a discussion on how nerds are insufficiently ambitious. I've observed this as well - consider Salman Khan's claim that his academy is [is not about replacing teachers, it’s about empowering teachers](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9568850/Khan-Academy-The-man-who-wants-to-teach-the-world.html).

Great article on a [Thiel Fellow addressing reputation problems in India](http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/06/oyo-rooms) - his startup [Oyo Rooms](http://www.oyorooms.com/) purports to provide hotel rooms with a guaranteed baseline of quality. I'll definitely try it out. Another article on [reducing information problems](http://logos.nationalinterest.in/2015/04/information-asymmetry-in-the-information-age/) w.r.t domestic help, travel and garbage collection.

[Free Monads are Simple](http://underscore.io/blog/posts/2015/04/14/free-monads-are-simple.html) by Noel Welsh. A very practical/coder perspective.

[Introduction to F-Algebras](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/bartosz/understanding-algebras) by Bartosz Milewski. A pretty simple explanation of how one can use F-Algebras (a category theory concept) to encode the concept of evaluation of expressions in a functional language.

[Postgres’s publish-subscribe features made better with JSON](https://blog.andyet.com/2015/04/06/postgres-pubsub-with-json).

[Managing a 14TB Reporting Data Warehouse](http://technology.inmobi.com/blog/managing-a-14tb-reporting-data-warehouse) on a single postgres instance.

[Python boltons](https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons) - a great library of stuff that probably should be added to the standard lib. Atomic file saving, queues, caches, etc.

Robin Hanson [hypothesizes](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/04/beware-general-visible-near-prey.html) that the great filter might consist of predator/prey dynamics descending to a low-dimensional subspace, since the resources needed by most spacefaring civilizations will be similar.

[Is China "destroying" the American middle class](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-03-25/what-s-destroying-middle-class-wages-china), while creating a massive middle class of their own? The papers Noah Smith links to are pretty good. This will surely be unpopular, and lends credence to causes (protectionism) I don't support, but it's very interesting nonetheless.

[No Physical Substrate, No Problem](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/07/no-physical-substrate-no-problem/). Scott Alexander discussing some fairly plausible mechanisms by which a superintelligent AI could bootstrap it's way from living on the internet to ruling the world.

[Harry Potter and the Philosophers Zombie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023949/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie). A very interesting fanfic addendum to the original fanfic. The same author also wrote [Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time), a very nice Terminator fanfic. From the author of [Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man).

[The Capitalist’s Zombie](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/04/15/the-capitalists-zombie/) is an article about capitalist simulations of local culture. One might ask whether starbucks effectively captures the essence of local hipster coffee shops - perhaps not. But what about Think Coffee? Compare a Capitalist's Zombie to a Philosopher's Zombie - a being which looks and behaves just like an ordinary human but is not conscious.

[Still not significant](https://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/). But there is a clear tendency toward significance (p=0.052), and I want to be published!

[Men Are More Likely to Go Back in Time and Kill Hitler Than Women Are, Says Study](https://www.vice.com/read/men-are-more-likely-to-go-back-in-time-and-kill-hitler-than-women-are-in-theory-909).

Fascinating article about how [Hasidic Jews pro-development attitudes keep housing prices down](http://observer.com/2013/03/weapons-of-mass-construction-satmars-secret-to-keeping-housing-prices-low/), at least in neighborhoods that they control. HT [@MarketUrbanism](https://twitter.com/MarketUrbanism).

[Tangles of Pathology](http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5876.html). In which the author argues that "You may pick two, but no more than two, of...Liberalism, Inequality [and] Nonpathology".

Anti-intellectualism watch: [Burn Her! She Would Act Like a Witch in a Situation That Will Never Come Up!](https://reason.com/blog/2015/04/02/burn-her-she-would-act-like-a-witch-in-a) I'm getting sick of these too, I just wish the world wouldn't provide so many.
