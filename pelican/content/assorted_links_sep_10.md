[A Different Box of Tools](http://vamsionnet.tripod.com/syjmf/adbt.htm), by Richard Feynman. There are two great things about this article. One is the "Feynman" method of debunking a theory - come up with simple examples that satisfy the theory yet are obviously false (typically look in mental areas different from the person cooking up the theory). The other is the friendly but adversarial scientific culture - "Although I gave the mathematicians a lot of trouble, they were always very kind to me." It's something that tech used to have, but is rapidly losing.
