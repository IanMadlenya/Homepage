Everything you think you know about test prep [is wrong](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/03/the-sat-test-prep-income-and-race.html). Specifically, test prep does almost nothing for test scores, there is little variation in test prep by income, and black people use it more than whites.

[The AAA Tranche of Subprime Science](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ChanceEthics10.pdf)

[Surprising facts about income inequality](http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2014/01/06-income-gains-and-inequality-burtless)

[Barratry](http://www.gwern.net/Barratry) (about a historical system of government)

What do you do after a major policy change? [Alter your measurement technique](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/us/politics/census-survey-revisions-mask-health-law-effects.html) in order to make "before" and "after" results incomparable. By a strange coincidence, "we are expecting much lower [better] numbers" - policy wonks will of course recognize this is "just because of the questions and how they are asked", but somehow I doubt innumerate reporters and the general public will.

How [Biju Dominic](http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/9p2odmjfwsXQPVhnfEj39I/The-new-think-tank.html) reduced pedestrian deaths on Bombay railway tracks. Very interestingly, he didn't try to dissuade people from crossing - he just tried to make safe crossing easier.

On the topic of HFT (which I know I'm beating to death), [Felix Salmon reblogs Joe Stiglitz](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/04/15/the-problems-of-hft-joe-stiglitz-edition/), and the original [Joe Stiglitz](http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/news/conferences/14fmc/Stiglitz.pdf). Unlike Michael Lewis, this is a critique worth reading, even if I disagree with some of the underlying premises (part of Stiglitz critique of HFT is that markets are not valuable, therefore HFT improving markets is not).

A nice [Comparision of different concurrency models: Actors, CSP, Disruptor and Threads](http://java-is-the-new-c.blogspot.ru/2014/01/comparision-of-different-concurrency.html). Nothing detailed, but nice overview.

Nassim Taleb [On the Biases in the Estimation of Inequality Using Bracketed Quantile Contributions](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8nhAlfIk3QIbzRrRkhhc1RNY0U/edit). A very interesting paper which shows that for a fixed level of power-law inequality, improvements in the ability to measure it will look like increases in inequality. This is a **very important bit of math**. I don't know why I didn't see it before.
