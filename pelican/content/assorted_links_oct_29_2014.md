[Handling Sparsity via the Horseshoe Prior](http://faculty.mccombs.utexas.edu/carlos.carvalho/Carvalhoetal2009.pdf). Very nice paper on Bayesian estimation of sparse signals.

[Recent Controversies in Scalaz land](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/scalaz/EBP_7sfB2ks/cV8aynO2TMkJ). Seems like a perfect illustration of how "codes of conduct" and the like are used to bully people. A secret, unannounced "code of conduct" is created and immediately used for the purpose of banning *the creator of Scalaz* from the IRC channel #scalaz, and said creator is also kicked off the github repo. The *creator of Scalaz*  is then [threatened](https://gist.github.com/ekmett/81a507f50d857345691c#file-demands-txt-L17) and told never to publicly discuss the project. Note that I'm speaking as one of the ["victims"](https://twitter.com/dibblego/status/517484030871080960) of Tony Morris's alleged bullying. I miss the days when political concerns like this were laughed out of the world of technology.

[Scientific Stagnation](http://www.gwern.net/the-long-stagnation), by Gwern. After reading this, I've now arrived at a considerably higher posterior that scientific stagnation is real. In short, Gwern debunks many of the arguments against it. He also makes an interesting for why he doesn't "buy the argument that the FDA is strangling all sorts of fantastic innovation through its focus on safety."

Illustrating Asymptotic Behavior, [part 1](http://davegiles.blogspot.ca/2014/10/illustrating-asymptotic-behaviour-part-i.html?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=stucchio) [part 2](http://davegiles.blogspot.ca/2014/10/illustrating-asymptotic-behaviour-part_12.html?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=stucchio) and [part 3](http://davegiles.blogspot.in/2014/10/illustrating-asymptotic-behaviour-part.html?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=stucchio). Great reading.

[The overhead of abstraction in Python vs C++](http://blog.reverberate.org/2014/10/the-overhead-of-abstraction-in-cc-vs.html)

[Bricolage by smart people](http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/10/13/bricolage-by-smart/)

[Articulating my confusion](http://updatedpriors.blogspot.in/2014/10/articulating-my-confusion.html?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=stucchio) on secular stagnation.

[Infotainment Journalism](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/06/infotainment-journalism/) and the Pop-Quant.

[Archiwindow](http://www.archdaily.com/556587/archiwindow-a-glimpse-through-the-eyes-of-architecture/?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=stucchio). Just click the link, it's interesting. And yes, my favorite happens to be Le Corbusier and Toyo Ito.

[Jezebel decides sex shaming is ok](http://fredrikdeboer.com/2014/10/08/jezebel-gets-in-on-some-sweet-sex-shaming/). Relatedly, [hard data is bro-stuff](https://twitter.com/zunguzungu/status/457644537679077376) and a [fetish for dude-bros](https://twitter.com/zunguzungu/status/457650311457296385). I truly don't understand why techies take these people seriously. That said,

![Inequality vs parental attitudes.](http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromMay2014/doepke%20fig4%2010%20oct.png) Correlations between [inequality and parental attitudes](http://www.voxeu.org/article/economics-parenting).
