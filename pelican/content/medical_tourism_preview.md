(For my American readers, that's about $125.)

I'm currently located in Pune, India, enjoying India's excellent medical system. I just had an MRI in preparation for more serious treatments. Once I've gone through the full experience, I'll be writing a detailed blog post on the topic.

India's medical system is interesting from an economic perspective because it's a counterexample to most of the talking points about health care one hears in the US. Patients here do price shop, prices are completely transparent, and it's generally a pleasant experience. It's also interesting for anyone interested in medical tourism - all told, the cost of my treatment is likely to be far lower than the cost of health insurance in NY.

This post is just a preview, but there is more to come on this topic.
