[Introduction to Automatic Differentiation](http://alexey.radul.name/ideas/2013/introduction-to-automatic-differentiation/). Very important and widely underappreciated. Now that I think of it, AD looks a lot like implementing nonstandard analyis in the computer.

[Complex Step Differentiation](http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2013/10/14/complex-step-differentiation/). This is so simple and perfect - for a real analytic function `f(x)`, `Im(f(x+ih)) = f'(z)+O(h^2)`. Proof is exactly what you think.

A [short tutorial](http://www.marketingdistillery.com/2014/09/26/estimating-the-impact-of-tv-advertisement-with-bayesian-state-space-models/) on using Google's [Causal Impact](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2014/09/causalimpact-new-open-source-package.html) to estimate the result of a TV ad.
