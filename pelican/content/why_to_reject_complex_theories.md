In a groundbreaking work back in 1975, Scott Alexander made a prediction of dire environmental consequences by the year 2015 if we don't change our behavior. His book [No Limits to Bears](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/03/the-guardian-vs-induction/) predicts an upcoming bearpocalypse and so far his predictions seem pretty accurate - I ran a statistical test and his predictions agree with the data with p<0.05.

Strangely, I don't think I've convinced any of my readers to start investing in bear traps. Why is that?

In principle Scott Alexander's bearpocalypse theory is falsifiable - we just wait until 2015 to see if hungry bears devour the world. But that doesn't really help us decide whether to start the mass production of bear traps today.

### Pastafarian Cosmology

Consider now a cosmological theory - Pastafarian Quantum Creationism. The theory claims the following. Let $@ H $@ be a standard quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. Then the wavefunction of the universe is described by:

$$ \partial_t \psi(\vec{x},t) = H \psi(\vec{x},t) + P(t) \psi(\vec{x},t) $$

where

$$ P(t) \equiv 0 \textrm{ for } t \geq 5,234 \textrm{BC}$$

The term $@ P(t) $@ represents the creational influence of his noodly goodness on the universe, specifically the creation of life.

Even in principle, **no experiment can ever distinguish** Pastafarian Quantum Creationism (PQC) from ordinary quantum mechanics, at least for experiments run after 5,234BC. That's because if the initial conditions are identical, and $@P(t) = 0$@, the wavefunctions must remain the same.

So in principle, any scientific experiment which forces us to reject PQC must also force us to reject QM.

Even more troubling is the fact that we also cannot run any scientific experiment to reject Heretical Pastafarian Quantum Creationism (HPQC) which asserts that his noodly goodness stopped influencing the world in 4,983BC rather than 5,234BC.

## Kolmogorov Complexity

Consider an abstract computer, for example a Turing Machine. In computing, a string S is said to have a Kolmogorov Complexity of k bits if the shortest program that can be used to compute S has k bits.

For example, on the Python interpreter the string `abababababababababababababababab` has complexity of 7 bytes, since it can be represented as the 7 byte program `'ab'*16`. In contrast, the string `4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7` probably has complexity of 32 bytes since it cannot be similarly reduced.

 The Kolmogorov Complexity of a theory T is the length (in bits) of the shortest program which can be used to represent the theory T.
