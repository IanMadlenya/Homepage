[The operating system: should there be one?](http://plosworkshop.org/2013/preprint/kell.pdf)

[Why Gilt uses Scala](http://readwrite.com/2014/05/08/gilt-eric-bowman-interview-scala-rails-jvm-reactive-platform)

[Frequentists are closet Bayesians](http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=11862)

Japan has the most awesome [reality TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgKg0Hc7YIA). Can 3 olympic fencers defeat 50 untrained swordsmen? Watch the video to find out.

[Rogoff critiques Piketty](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/kenneth-rogoff-says-that-thomas-piketty-is-right-about-rich-countries--but-wrong-about-the-world). This is much the same as my fundamental critique - Piketty has no model, and seems ignorant of global inequality.

My favorite new memes: [Scumbag Analytic Philosopher](http://memegenerator.net/Scumbag-Analytic-Philosopher) and [Scumbag Continental Philosopher](http://memegenerator.net/Scumbag-Continental-Philosopher/images/popular).

A discussion on the [Philosophy of Lovecraft](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/19/i-liked-lovecraft-countless-primaeval-aeons-before-it-was-cool/).

Robin Hanson [asks the important question](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/05/howimportantisinequality.html) - if education, female empowerment and assortative mating cause inequality, should we attempt to reduce these things?

Freddy DeBoer on [Free Speech Rights and Ability](http://fredrikdeboer.com/2014/04/18/free-speech-rights-and-ability/). Interesting article from a liberal perspective on the new blacklist.

Interesting discussion on the philosophy of [Clarence Thomas](http://crookedtimber.org/2014/05/08/clarence-thomass-counterrevolution/). Even more interesting when you consider the source - I generally expect crookedtimber to do little more than sneer at him.

Interesting [FAQ by Jayman](http://jaymans.wordpress.com/jaymans-race-inheritance-and-iq-f-a-q-f-r-b/) on Human Biodiversity. An interesting blog in general.

[Meant for Each Other: Open Borders and Western Civilization](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/05/meant_for_each.html), by Bryan Caplan. I find him generally unconvincing on [keyhole solutions](http://openborders.info/keyhole-solutions/) (hard to implement in the US political system) and [political externalities](http://openborders.info/political-externalities/) (Indian election 2014: [rape apologist](http://zeenews.india.com/zeenews.india.com/news/nation/boys-err-at-times-wrong-to-hang-rapists-mulayam-singh-yadav_923565.html) vs [instigator of religious riots](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3393808.ece?homepage=true) vs yet another Gandhi). Nevertheless, most of my software engineer friends (to say nothing of non upper-middle class people) enjoy a consumption level comparable to that of American non-workers - immigration is by far the only plausible solution to this. Bryan Caplan's core point is solid, even if his arguments need a bit of work.

[Neil Degrasse Tyson's Scientism](http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=12340)

[Zachary David](http://zacharydavid.com/2014/04/on-hft-part-ii-bugs-features-and-aggressive-incompetence/) calls out Eric Hunsader (of Nanex) for spreading BS. He also [takes down](http://zacharydavid.com/2014/05/know-thy-model-specificity-and-the-importance-of-using-fake-data/) a paper pushing the myth of quote stuffing.

Awesome visualization of [population and GDP](http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.in/2014/05/gdp-snapshots-from-international.html).
