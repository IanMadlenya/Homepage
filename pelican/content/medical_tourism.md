IMAGE OF MRI

That's my spine, and if you know what to look for you can see that the intervertebral disk is bulging and pressing on my spinal column. At the time this photo was taken I was unable to sit through lunch. I needed help, and in this article I'll describe my experience with medical tourism in India.

About me: I'm not Indian, I speak little Marathi beyond "pani" and "buzz", and in general I stick out like a big (about 9-12" bigger than average) fair and lovely advertisement over here. My girlfriend is an African woman about 3-5" taller than the average man, and with a hairstyle that is rather uncommon over here. If we visit a restaurant twice, we are immediately recognized the second time around - suffice it to say that we have no chance of passing for locals. Nevertheless, I'm familiar with the country - I know when an auto driver is ripping me off and I negotiate better than many Indians. So in short, I have a mild advantage for medical tourism over the average westerner, but not a huge one.

Currency and numbers: At the time I'm writing this, and the time of my surgery, 1 USD = 60 INR. India has an interesting number system - 1 lakh = 1,00,000 (one hundred thousand), and 1 crore = 1,00,00,000 = 100 lakh. So 1 lakh rupees = $1600, and 1 crore rupees = $160,000.

This post is written mainly from an American perspective. When I was in the US recently, an [article about spine surgery](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/us/drive-by-doctoring-surprise-medical-bills.html) was floating around. The punch line? In the US, it's difficult to get a doctor to give you a cost estimate *before* you undergo surgery. In the particular case discussed by this article, which is apparently not particularly uncommon, there was $117,000 *discrepancy* between the estimated and final bill.

I'm going to discuss an experience I had with a similar surgery over here.

# Eyeball repairs - my first medical tourism experience

My first official bit of medical tourism was several months back. My problem: I was born with a congenital defect that blurs my vision. I worked around this defect for a long time by putting corrective lenses in front of my eyeballs, but that became extremely inconvenient. During exercise the corrective lenses would fall off if I did burpees or pushups. When it rained they would get wet and difficult to see through. Since getting rid of them I've also observed people to find me more sexually attractive and less intelligent.

Through the magic of lasers, this problem is permanently fixable. I did some research and knew the procedure I wanted - [wavefront guided femtolasik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntraLASIK). I started looking up prices, and a typical price in the US was $2000 or 1.2 lakh rupees **per eye**. Most of the better places will cost considerably more. I started googling for prices in India but that was rather more difficult - the general price range I got was anywhere from 15-40k rupees per eye. Quite a price difference. So I asked around and got a recommendation - Aditya Kelkar at the [National Institute of Opthamology](http://www.nioeyes.com/), supposedly one of the best places in India.

It was a little difficult to find the place, but when I got there the facility was clean and modern - more or less what you'd expect in the US, apart from minor differences like the lack of paper cups for the water cooler. (The custom here is a shared metal cup which you don't put your lips on.)

Once I got there, they were a little surprised to see a foreigner walking in and asking for service, but very professional. On the day I walked in I was given an examination to determine if LASIK was a reasonable procedure for me - I forget the exact price, but I believe it was was approximately 3000INR ~= $50. After this exam revealed LASIK was appropriate, I had a consultation with the doctor. He explained the procedure and the risks in a very low pressure environment. One thing I liked a lot about him was that he steered me away from a different form of LASIK which sounds less scary (it does not require the creation of a flap in the eye), but which is less effective.

After a few days of thought I decided to go ahead with the surgery. We did one eye only at first since I wanted to make sure that if something bad happened (there is a small risk of infection) or if the results did not give me vision as good as I had with glasses, I could skip the second eye. This was not the standard procedure, but Kelkar was happy to let me roll with it. The first eye took several weeks to recover, but eventually I was completely satisfied with my vision. During the recovery I was able to function normally, travel to [Jaipur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur) and [Mumbai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai) and generally enjoy myself. When I returned to Pune I had the right eye done - recovery in that eye was only a few days.

Overall, I had a great experience. The total cost was 34.5k rupees = $550/eye, plus another 1,000 or so rupees on medication (eye drops, painkillers).

# Spine repairs - the biggie

Before I left India, I started to develop a second problem. Or rather, a second problem recurred - a herniated disk in my back. This is an old problem, one I've had since 2004. In 2012 I had a major flareup, requiring a micro lumbar diskectomy of the L5/S1 disk. For those unfamiliar with the anatomy of the spine, here is a diagram borrowed from [Highland Chiropractic](http://www.highlandchiro.com/spinal_chart.html):

![diagram of the spine](http://www.highlandchiro.com/images/spinal_chart.jpg)

The disks are the white cusions between the vertebrae - the problematic one in 2012 was the one between the L5 vertebrae and the Sacrum. A herniation is when the disk protrudes from between the vertebrae and compresses the spinal column, like so:

![herniation diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/Lumbar_Disc_Lesions%2C_Classification_by_Harry_Gouvas.jpg)

This time, in 2014, the problem was in the disk between L4/L5. This disk was visibly damaged in 2012, but not causing problems so repair was deferred. Last may it started to become a problem. I started off feeling pain down the right leg, and eventually even sitting down became problematic.

I decided to visit Rajesh Parasnis at [Oyster and Pearl Clinic](http://www.onphospital.com/)
