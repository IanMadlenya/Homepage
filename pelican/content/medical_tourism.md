IMAGE OF MRI

That's my spine, and if you know what to look for you can see that the intervertebral disk is bulging and pressing on my spinal column. At the time this photo was taken I was unable to sit through lunch. I needed help, and in this article I'll describe my experience with medical tourism in India.

About me: I'm not Indian, I speak little Marathi beyond "pani" and "buzz", and in general I stick out like a sore thumb over here. Nevertheless, I'm familiar with the country - I know when an auto driver is ripping me off, and I negotiate better than many Indians.

Currency and numbers: At the time I'm writing this, and the time of my surgery, 1 USD = 60 INR. India has an interesting number system - 1 lakh = 1,00,000 (one hundred thousand), and 1 crore = 1,00,00,000 = 100 lakh. So 1 lakh rupees = $1600, and 1 crore rupees = $160,000.

# Eyeball repairs

My first official bit of medical tourism was several months back. My problem: I was born with a congenital defect that blurs my vision. I worked around this defect for a long time by putting corrective lenses in front of my eyeballs, but that became extremely inconvenient. When working out the lenses would fall off if I did burpees. When it rained they would get wet and difficult to see through. They weren't all bad - people thought I appeared more intelligent with them.

Through the magic of lasers, this problem is now permanently fixable. I did some research and knew the procedure I wanted - [wavefront guided femtolasik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntraLASIK). I started looking up prices, and a typical price in the US was $2000 or 1.2 lakh rupees **per eye**. I started googling for prices in India but that was rather more difficult - the general price range I got was anywhere from 15-30k rupees per eye. Quite a price difference. So I asked around and got a recommendation - Aditya Kelkar at the [National Institute of Opthamology](http://www.nioeyes.com/).

It was a little difficult to find the place, but when I got there the facility was clean and modern - more or less what you'd expect in the US, apart from minor differences like the lack of paper cups for the water cooler.
