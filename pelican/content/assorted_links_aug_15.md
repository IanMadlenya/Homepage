[Unspoken Ground Assumptions of Discussion](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/03/unspoken-ground-assumptions-of-discussion/). A very important insight:

> ...someone proposing a really insightful possibility... and someone else saying "This is dumb, you don’t have nearly enough evidence to prove this, you’re just shooting your mouth off". Of course, everything starts as a hypothesis with less than enough evidence to be completely proven. It’s only after something has been proposed that people are able to study it further. What do they expect – that a theory bursts forth fully formed onto the Earth with hundreds of supporting papers and experiments by a community of scholars who have been working totally in secret until that time? People tend to bring up this objection only when the hypothesis is something they want to nip in the bud for political reasons, before anyone pays attention and tries to gather evidence.
