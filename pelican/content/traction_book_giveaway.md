I previously wrote a [review](|filename|traction_book_review.md) of Gabriel Weinberg's new book [Traction: A Startup Guide to Getting Customers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976339609/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0976339609&linkCode=as2&tag=christuc-20&linkId=7VRVMNOJHRGUFU2A).  I was lucky enough to receive a pre-release copy of it, and for the most part all I can say is that it was an excellent book. The gist of my review is [go buy it right now](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976339609/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0976339609&linkCode=as2&tag=christuc-20&linkId=7VRVMNOJHRGUFU2A).

Now it's even more useful to buy. If you purchase before Sept 15 and email your receipt to Weinberg, you'll get a number of [other bonuses](http://discuss.tractionbook.com/t/bonuses-for-buying-traction/215).

An additional benefit of the tractoin book that I didn't mention in my previous review - in the book, they discuss the mechanics and value of stupid publicity stunts like this.
