Scott Sumner [compares US poverty in 1967 to the present](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=26908&utm_source=feedburner&utm_source=stucchio).

Jayman on the [Hajnal line](https://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/big-summary-post-on-the-hajnal-line/), which divides nuclear family + outbreeding patterns from extended family + inbreeding patterns.

Some clever programmer makes [subtle](http://www.modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-newest-frontier) [parody](http://www.modelviewculture.com/pieces/how-perks-can-divide-us). The [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/shanley) gave away the joke.
