Great blog post [showing the difference between confidence and credible intervals](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/12/frequentism-and-bayesianism-3-confidence-credibility/).

[Get the Science out of your Yogurt](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2014/06/05/get_the_science_out_of_your_yogurt.php?utm_source=stucchio)

Gelman, Hill and Yajima on [Bayesian multiple comparisons](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/multiple2.pdf) via multilevel models.

Once in a while [Michael O. Church](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7853434) is amazingly insightful. [Leaders vs Leavers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7853434).

Scott Sumner [compares US poverty in 1967 to the present](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=26908&utm_source=feedburner&utm_source=stucchio).

Jayman on the [Hajnal line](https://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/big-summary-post-on-the-hajnal-line/), which divides nuclear family + outbreeding patterns from extended family + inbreeding patterns. It feels like a just-so story to me, though I've checked a few of his references and they do seem solid. Also: [Guns don't kill people, hillbillies and mexicans do](http://jaymans.wordpress.com/2014/06/11/guns-violence-again/).

[How a Russian mathematician constructed a decision tree - by hand - to solve a medical problem](http://fastml.com/how-a-russian-mathematician-constructed-a-decision-tree-by-hand-to-solve-a-medical-problem/)

[Stanley Kubrick's Interiors](http://www.archdaily.com/514027/interiors-stanley-kubrick/?utm_source=chrisstucchio&utm_medium=bloglink) and the [Domino Sugar Factory](http://www.archdaily.com/514373/in-images-the-domino-sugar-factory-s-beautiful-decline/?utm_source=chrisstucchio&utm_medium=bloglink) on archdaily.

[Good Badlands](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/06/good-badlands-guy-tal/?utm_source=chrisstucchio&utm_medium=bloglink)

[The internet is not a safe space](http://reason.com/blog/2014/06/18/the-internet-is-not-a-safe-space). Two related questions. First, was it "violence" when journalists quoted Pax Dickinson's tweets without permission? Second, has the US gone completely insane since I left?

Some clever brogrammer makes [subtle](http://www.modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-newest-frontier) [parody](http://www.modelviewculture.com/pieces/how-perks-can-divide-us). The [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/shanley) gives away the joke.
