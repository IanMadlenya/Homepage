The last month or so of my life hasn't been awesome. But life is improving. I'm now out of the hospital, having received a micro-lumbar diskectomy. While I was inside, I had a lot of time to read - as a result, here come reviews of the books that were notable.

# Foundations of Data Science, by John Hopcroft and Ravindran Kannan

Summary: [Go read this book now](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/navingo/e0-229.aspx).

Data science tends to consist of two somewhat disparate parts. On the one hand, there are a variety of practical algorithms, together with various tricks for implementing them, which can be used more or less as black box learning tools. Most of the textbooks I've seen focus on describing these algorithms, while providing enough theory to get to the point where they can be explained. On the other hand, there is quite a bit of mathematical theory and intuition, which most books don't provide a great deal of explanation for.

As a concrete example, consider a higher dimensional vector space - a set of points `[x1, x2, ..., xn]` for `n=100` or `n=1000`.

 These books are great if you want to actually *implement* a learning system. But if it doesn't quite work, they don't usually give you enough knowledge to move forward.

The other part of data science consists of a variety of mathematical fundamentals. These come from fairly disparate parts of math - for example, the geometry of higher dimensional spaces.

Data science very often consists of the study of high dimensional vectors.

# Antifragile, by Nassim Taleb

Summary: You'll feel smart but you won't learn anything.

# Flash Boys, by Michael Lewis

Summary: If you don't already know how HFT works, you'll find yourself dumber than before you read the book.

I finally got around to finishing this book.
